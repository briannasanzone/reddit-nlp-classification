       "&gt; Really ? This is the first time I'm hearing this , does the state pay for the healthcare expenses ?\\n\\nYes.    Longevity treatments are intended to extend health by reversing age related damage/disease.  Once it becomes an approved therapy, it falls under healthcare rather than something hypothetical at this point.
