How much could our woefully pathetic mental / emotional health care system benefit if we could free the Human race from the scourge of so many of life's current age related diseases?  
No, I don't mean longer lives would magically allow people to become more mentally healthy.  I mean that I believe / hope that the advent of seriously extended lifespans would elevate the importance of mental health and intervention.  We would ALL want a world were people were mentally sound, because these sorts of trauma ultimately effect us all. 

Today, declining heath and age related death is an accepted inevitability.  But what if it weren't?  Could not the desire for and quality of help be magnified by a longer, healthy life?  No, it would not be immediate and mental therapy is not fast.  But  50 years?  100 years?  At what point does breaking the chain of generational evil become ""worth it?""

10.0,chromosomalcrossover,"Excerpts:

&gt;  Health professionals and journal editors reading the results of a clinical trial assume that the trial happened and that the results were honestly reported. But about 20% of the time, said Ben Mol, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash Health, they would be wrong. As I’ve been concerned about research fraud for 40 years, I wasn’t that surprised as many would be by this figure, but it led me to think that the time may have come to stop assuming that research actually happened and is honestly reported, and assume that the research is fraudulent until there is some evidence to support it having happened and been honestly reported.


&gt; As he described in a webinar last week, Ian Roberts, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, began to have doubts about the honest reporting of trials after a colleague asked if he knew that his systematic review showing the mannitol halved death from head injury was based on trials that had never happened. He didn’t, but he set about investigating the trials and confirmed that they hadn’t ever happened. They all had a lead author who purported to come from an institution that didn’t exist and who killed himself a few years later. The trials were all published in prestigious neurosurgery journals and had multiple co-authors. None of the co-authors had contributed patients to the trials, and some didn’t know that they were co-authors until after the trials were published. When Roberts contacted one of the journals the editor responded that “I wouldn’t trust the data.” Why, Roberts wondered, did he publish the trial? None of the trials have been retracted.

&gt; Later Roberts, who headed one of the Cochrane groups, did a systematic review of colloids versus crystalloids only to discover again that many of the trials that were included in the review could not be trusted. He is now sceptical about all systematic reviews, particularly those that are mostly reviews of multiple small trials. He compared the original idea of systematic reviews as searching for diamonds, knowledge that was available if brought together in systematic reviews; now he thinks of systematic reviewing as searching through rubbish. He proposed that small, single centre trials should be discarded, not combined in systematic reviews.

&gt; Mol, like Roberts, has conducted systematic reviews only to realise that most of the trials included either were zombie trials that were fatally flawed or were untrustworthy. What, he asked, is the scale of the problem? Although retractions are increasing, only about 0.04% of biomedical studies have been retracted, suggesting the problem is small. But the anaesthetist John Carlisle analysed 526 trials submitted to Anaesthesia and found that 73 (14%) had false data, and 43 (8%) he categorised as zombie. When he was able to examine individual patient data in 153 studies, 67 (44%) had untrustworthy data and 40 (26%) were zombie trials. Many of the trials came from the same countries (Egypt, China, India, Iran, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey), and when John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanford University, examined individual patient data from trials submitted from those countries to Anaesthesia during a year he found that many were false: 100% (7/7) in Egypt; 75% (3/ 4) in Iran; 54% (7/13) in India; 46% (22/48) in China; 40% (2/5) in Turkey; 25% (5/20) in South Korea; and 18% (2/11) in Japan. Most of the trials were zombies. Ioannidis concluded that there are hundreds of thousands of zombie trials published from those countries alone.

&gt; Others have found similar results, and Mol’s best guess is that about 20% of trials are false. Very few of these papers are retracted.

&gt; We have now reached a point where those doing systematic reviews must start by assuming that a study is fraudulent until they can have some evidence to the contrary.

Something to think about as inevitably people will claim to have results of clinical trials that relate to aging breakthroughs, and they may not be from top tier institutions.

18.0,Walouisi,"This is my sticking point with Aubrey too. He assumes that once it's properly communicated that the treatments are tangible, it'll be a unanimous revelation for the public at large and every politician not on board will be passed over. This seems unbelievably optimistic, to the point of ignoring numerous facets of human psychology and our present society. And I'd actually argue that this might be for the best- if the prospect of unlimited healthy lifespan appeared overnight and were taken perfectly seriously by all, it'd become a huge topic of really stupid debate, of controversy, and could even be targeted by a huge variety of extremist groups. Even after that, the sudden impact of having to overhaul the pensions system overnight (severe reductions/increasing pensions age/less access) given it's a huge source of taxation spending for most countries, would cause huge unrest. I'm actually far more comfortable with the prospect of it sneaking up on most people in the form of a wonderful new drug every few years that combats some horrible aspect of aging (frailty/dementia/skin integrity/osteoperosis/organ function/immune function etc), since people are far more likely to be enthusiastic about the idea of aunt Mabel not dying from a broken hip or their parent not forgetting who they are.

Just as Aubrey always says, life extension is the side-effect of health. Maximum ages and average lifespans can increase as healthspan increases and people won't kick up such a fuss about that if it's causing the healthcare burden to go down rather than up. It'd be a shift and something to come to terms with, sure, but it's a whole lot more difficult to argue against new drugs or regimens one by one which reduce suffering and the healthcare burden, than against ""it's immortality time"". And, again, this is actually how I see it going. Even if we were on the verge of a full suite of effective, reusable treatments, laymen would really struggle to recognise that it really would be the end of death by aging until people are breaking the max age records on a daily basis and medical professionals are reporting that they have 70yo patients who look and function like they're in their 30s, or 110s in their 40s etc. But this all allows the wide social acceptance and recognition of the reduced suffering and financial burden of these drugs to happen naturally and incrementally instead of going straight to contentious or deathist debate and scrutiny.

I understand totally that he wants and has spent his life hoping for and working towards a moment where the world sees his mission for what it is and start removing obstacles instead of throwing them at us. But, even with these new developments, even with possible big-time backing from a billionaire, even if we get a media frenzy and *more* people start to take the possibility seriously, I just can't bring myself to think it will really play out the way he hopes.

19.0,greyuniwave,"&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or ‘blue zones’, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and ‘supercentenarian’ status. In the United States supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. In the UK, Italy, Japan, and France remarkable longevity is instead predicted by regional poverty, old-age poverty, material deprivation, low incomes, high crime rates, a remote region of birth, worse health, and fewer 90+ year old people. In addition, supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on the first of the month and days divisible by five: patterns indicative of widespread fraud and error. As such, relative poverty and missing vital documents constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status, and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",4,1626591577,longevity

&gt; **What have studies shown about the effects of senolytics?**

&gt; Studies in mice suggest that by destroying senescent cells, senolytics extended life by as much as 27 percent, which is pretty considerable. I want to be careful about extrapolating, but for illustrative purposes, life expectancy in the US before COVID was almost 79 years. If the mouse results were to apply in humans, that would boost life expectancy to 100 years.

&gt; It’s not just that the mice lived longer, since if they were unhealthy, that wouldn’t be good. Encouragingly, results from senolytic studies include better cardiac function, less dementia, fewer cataracts, and reduced muscle loss.

&gt; Early studies with human volunteers, which are designed to first test for safety, offer grounds for optimism. In one three-week trial, 14 patients with pulmonary fibrosis walked further, faster, and rose more quickly from their chairs after receiving a handful of doses of senolytics. I want to be cautious and note that there was not a control group for this early-stage study, the participants took additional medications, and many aspects of the disease did not improve.

&gt; The field is undergoing explosive growth, with as many as 100 companies exploring senolytics. Academic researchers are just as active. For example, there’s a clinical trial for senolytics with diabetic kidney disease and another for addressing frailty. There are many others. The FDA process emphasizes drugs for specific diseases, so researchers are testing senolytics for individual conditions, even if they might have broader implications for aging.



&gt; **What does your senolytic research focus on?**

&gt; There is a specific fatty acid made in small amounts in the body called dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid or DGLA. It’s also present in tiny amounts in the diet. When I gave aged mice larger amounts of DGLA, they went from having quite a few senescent cells to having significantly fewer.

&gt; This presents a new therapeutic target. I identified a candidate compound using the DGLA metabolic pathway that works at a dose that is over 1,000 times lower than fisetin, so you can imagine we’re quite excited by these results.

&gt; Like many biomedical discoveries, it was accidental. DGLA makes anti-inflammatory lipids, which help alleviate conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. I was studying this aspect of DGLA when I was surprised to discover that it killed senescent cells.

&gt; My work is in its very early stages, and we’ve only studied a small number of mice, so it’s too early for even tentative conclusions, although I’m obviously pleased that we’ve seen the elimination of a meaningful number of senescent cells in old mice. We’ll be closely monitoring DGLA’s positive effects as well as any negative effects on the mice.  

&gt; **How would DGLA be given to people?**

&gt; We are several years away from that, because everything has to be perfect with mice before we even think about trials with people.

&gt; First, we have to figure out how DGLA is killing senescent cells in mice. Again, not all studies with mice yield similar results in humans, so we are very careful about how we convey our findings and possible future actions.

&gt; But being at the HNRCA, I have met USDA researchers and nutrition scientists, and discovered that some of those folks were developing DGLA-enriched soybeans. In one scenario, you might go out for sushi and get a little bowl of DGLA-enriched edamame as a side. By the time you’re done eating, you’ve helped reduce the odds of getting some age-related pathology.

&gt; I don’t know if it will play out that way, but it’s an idea we’re working toward. I also am working on therapies that elevate the amount of naturally occurring DGLA in senescent cells that I am very excited about, so this would be an alternative approach.

&gt; **You are also studying ways to test senolytic therapies beyond such measures as improvement in distance walked, right?**

&gt; Yes, I am developing a quick and easy test to tell if senolytic therapy is working. Testing for senolytic effectiveness is not really being done now—you just look for improvement in symptoms or functioning and essentially conclude that it’s due to the therapy.

&gt; But we can’t say that with full confidence. Currently, researchers obtain skin or fat samples from patients in these trials before and after senolytic treatment to look for senescent cells. But this is an invasive procedure and it’s especially challenging for older people to undergo this testing.

&gt; One way to solve this dilemma is to identify a biomarker, a measurable compound that consistently and reliably can confirm an intervention’s effectiveness. For example, we know that a certain lipid, dihomo-15d-PGJ2, accumulates in large amounts inside of senescent cells.

&gt; When we give a senolytic therapy that kills these cells in mice or human cells, this lipid is liberated. Detecting it in blood and urine is far less invasive, so that’s what I’m working on now. Our aim is to be able to test people receiving senolytic therapy for the presence of dihomo-15d-PGJ2 in their blood and urine by the end of the summer.

&gt;  **Should people be taking these supplements based on these early findings?**

&gt; I’m a researcher, not a health-care provider, and people should consult their health-care provider before taking supplements.

&gt; Here’s what I think: People should not look at early positive test results from studies in mice and start taking senolytic supplements. First, supplements are poorly regulated. At the basic level, there is no guarantee that you’re going to get what it says on the bottle.

&gt; Second, you don’t know what else has been added to the supplement.

&gt; Third, even if something works in mice, it is far from certain that it will work in humans.

&gt; Fourth, taking supplements may be harmful in some cases. If you take a senolytic supplement and have surgery, or a wound, senolytics could weaken the capacity of the body to respond properly.

&gt; And in light of the importance of senescent cells in embryo formulation, most definitely don’t take them if you are or could be pregnant. This field is in its infancy; we have so much more work to do with safety and efficacy.",16,1626268797,longevity

The Center for Healthy Aging (CHA) has a 40 year history of research excellence and of training researchers who have helped shape aging science.  Current research conducted by Pathways faculty mentors includes understanding the role daily stress plays in shaping long-term health trajectories, tracking the enduring effects of early childhood adversity and chronic stress on momentary self-regulation, elucidating the endocrine and inflammatory processes underlying cognitive aging, identifying molecular targets mediating age-related vascular dysfunction, and linking chronic sleep deficiency to cardiometabolic outcomes.

&gt;Pathways fellows have two mentors: one faculty member conducting psychosocial/behavioral research and one conducting biological research.  Fellows in the Pathways program can receive hands-on experience in designing and implementing intensive repeated measure studies (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, measurement burst designs, and daily diaries).  With the aid of their faculty mentors, fellows can explore daily diary and ambulatory cortisol assessments; analyze data from projects that include smartphones and ambulatory technology to assess behavior, emotion, physiology and cognitive function in naturalistic settings; measure sympathetic nerve outflow and real-time microvessel function; and assess sleep in both naturalistic and experimental settings.

Topics of how to integrate anti-aging into society from a variety of perspectives, including socioeconomic. It's easy to cover research on animals and what makes them longer/better. It's easy to interview researchers who study aging processes. It's relatively easy to give examples on how to maximize genetic potential, for motivated individuals.   


What's missing is a larger conversation on how to normalise anti-aging, how individuals can beat the odds stacked against them when it comes to making their lifestyles healthy. Every little feature of society is meticulously crafted to kill and age you faster. A person who can't find time/resources or possibilities to do exercise and diet (as the most basic steps) wouldn't even dream of thinking of anti-aging. Why aspire for such heights even if the low-level health benchmarks are hard to meet? Why live longer for those whose life is miserable and there's no light at the end of the tunnel?   


Those motivated enough to practice anti-aging/participate in research/invest etc are already doing it. They are not the target audience in my opinion. It's preaching to the converted. The hard goal is to incorporate longevity topics into everyday real life.   


Perhaps conversations would be vastly different when targeting younger and older people. Personally, as I communicate to mostly younger people (as a science communicator), the socioeconomic problems are the first things to arise, followed by culture.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a progressive disorder that is characterized by accumulated deposits of calcium (calcification) and other minerals in elastic fibers, which are a component of connective tissue. Calcification can affect elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and blood vessels, causing decreased blood flow.

**Interim readout in ongoing Phase 1 trial finds single 0.3 mg/kg dose of NTLA-2001 led to 87% mean reduction in serum TTR, with a maximum 96% serum TTR reduction by day 28, with dose-dependent response**


**Encouraging safety profile; no serious adverse events observed in the first six patients by day 28**

C Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) today announced positive interim data from an ongoing Phase 1 clinical study of their lead in vivo genome editing candidate, NTLA-2001, which is being developed as a single-dose treatment for transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. The Phase 1 study, run by Intellia as the program’s development and commercialization lead, is evaluating NTLA-2001 in people living with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). NTLA-2001 is the first CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy candidate to be administered systemically, via intravenous infusion, for precision editing of a gene in a target tissue in humans. NTLA-2001 is designed to inactivate the TTR gene in liver cells to prevent the production of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein, which accumulates in tissues throughout the body and causes the debilitating and often fatal complications of ATTR amyloidosis. The interim data were presented today at the 2021 Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) Annual Meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine (nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454.)1.

“These are the first ever clinical data suggesting that we can precisely edit target cells within the body to treat genetic disease with a single intravenous infusion of CRISPR. The interim results support our belief that NTLA-2001 has the potential to halt and reverse the devastating complications of ATTR amyloidosis with a single dose,” said Intellia President and Chief Executive Officer John Leonard, M.D. “Solving the challenge of targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 to the liver, as we have with NTLA-2001, also unlocks the door to treating a wide array of other genetic diseases with our modular platform, and we intend to move quickly to advance and expand our pipeline. With these data, we believe we are truly opening a new era of medicine.”

The interim data released today cover the first six ATTRv-PN patients across two single-ascending dose cohorts of the Phase 1 study, which is currently being conducted in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Single doses of either 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg of NTLA-2001 were administered systemically. Reductions in serum TTR levels were measured from baseline to day 28. Treatment with NTLA-2001 led to dose-dependent reductions in serum TTR, with mean reductions of 52% among the three patients in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group, and 87% among the three patients in the 0.3 mg/kg dose group, including one patient with a 96% reduction. By contrast, the standard of care for ATTRv-PN, which requires chronic treatment, typically yields TTR reductions of approximately 80%.

“This is exciting early data both for people living with this devastating disease and for the entire scientific community working to maximize the potential of genetics-based medicines through cutting-edge research and technologies,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron, which first partnered with Intellia in 2016 to advance CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology for in vivo therapeutic development. “Thanks to large-scale human genetics research, there have been many new genetic targets identified and confirmed to have an impact on human health. Combining this knowledge with the precision and enhanced convenience of a single CRISPR infusion unlocks new possibilities in treating – and potentially even curing – life-threatening and historically difficult-to-address diseases.”

At both dose levels, NTLA-2001 was generally well-tolerated by the six patients included in the interim analysis, with no serious adverse events and no liver findings by day 28. Given the safety and tolerability profile so far, NTLA-2001 is continuing to be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of the study, to determine if a higher dose could result in a deeper reduction in disease-causing protein levels leading to the potential for more meaningful clinical benefit. As of the date of this release, Cohort 3, evaluating NTLA-2001 at the 1 mg/kg dose level, is actively enrolling.

Following the identification of a recommended dose in the dose-escalation portion of the study, Intellia expects to begin a single-dose expansion cohort in Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial later this year. After completion of the Phase 1 trial, the company plans to move to pivotal studies for both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis.

“ATTR amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal disease that usually requires chronic, lifelong treatment. These interim Phase 1 data support NTLA-2001 as the only one-time treatment either on the market or in development,” said Julian Gillmore, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, U.K., and the Phase 1 study’s national coordinating investigator. “As the first-ever systemically administered CRISPR therapy candidate, NTLA-2001 shows strong potential to stop the production and accumulation of the misfolded TTR protein by inactivating the TTR gene at the root of the disease. This approach could deliver life-changing, lifelong benefits to patients with all forms of ATTR amyloidosis, who continue to experience debilitating symptoms and complications of disease while on the standard of care. While further investigation is needed, these results are highly encouraging.”

Intellia intends to present additional data from the study at a medical or scientific meeting later this year.",8,1625929578,longevity

Moderation analysis was performed to test whether the association between age and olfactory impairment was moderated by handgrip strength. Moderation analysis highlighted two regions of significance: the first region was found at &lt; 56.6 kg, indicating that the adverse influence of age on olfactory function may be greater for the participants in this area; the second region was found at ≥ 56.6 kg, indicating that the negative impact of age on olfactory function disappeared for adults who were above this estimate point.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal. That means that we still do not fully understand telomeres or their role in aging and disease. So trying to lengthen or shorten your telomeres as a health intervention is arguably premature and, at worst, harmful, some experts say.

&gt; And there is no recognized optimal telomere length for health. According to Blackburn, that makes the idea of telling someone their cellular age based on the length of their telomeres problematic — at least for now.

&gt; Still another hurdle is that measurements of telomere length vary depending on the method used to test them. Some testing procedures look at the length of all the telomeres in a given blood sample and give you the average — the method that Telomere Diagnostics uses — while other tests focus exclusively on the shortest telomeres in a sample.

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

[Analysis of the Association Between TERC and TERT Genetic Variation and Leukocyte Telomere Length and Human Lifespan—A Follow-Up Study (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/2/82/htm)

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.

From what I have been reading sleep should be under physical body and brain health as well as mental. During sleep is when the body heals the physical body and cleans out the physical brain. During sleep is also when the body resets the circadian clock that in turn regulates various body hormones—some of which are related to weight gain and obesity.

I believe more studies are needed but I read one place (again from memory) that the first six hours of sleep is the body healing the body and it is during the seventh hour of sleep that the brain starts on the physical brain and heals it as well.

My post was focused on lifespan extension, because all of this that you mentioned concerns healthspan. Which is important, but is not the subject of my post. Clinical trials can assess that, but for lifespan - you really need age of death as an end point, and in humans that means a clinical trial could last for 50+ years (depending on when the manipulation is started). Health indices are fine, but they tell us about healthspan. Epigenetic clocks are fine, I guess, that's not my main topic of inquiry but I've read some pretty heavy criticisms of the Horvath clock. Not an expert on that tho, maybe someone can chime in.

I'm just saying that it's more logical to look at longer-lived species than us to find manipulations to extend lifespan, rather than shorter-lived species.

It's not just enough to extend life, you want to extend the healthy part of life because the sick/frail/declining/vulnerable part of life makes up a significant chunk of the time you're alive and makes it worse for you, your family, and society in general.

If physical capacity is improved, if immune system health is improved, and the general lack of disease of other organs (think of eye disease) - then you could start to see the needle moved on people being functionally younger for their age.  

Age of death is a remote concern in comparison to decreasing age related disease.

Human clinical trials can also start to measure biomarkers of aging.      Epigenetic clocks and similar newer generation clocks are aiming to be more predictive of disease, disability, and even time to death.   Check out Steve Horvath's work for example: https://youtu.be/LuQKXux8UlE

Full Abstract:
&gt; As the global elderly population grows, it is socioeconomically and medically critical to have diverse and effective means of mitigating the impact of aging on human health. Previous studies showed that adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) vector induced overexpression of certain proteins can suppress or reverse the effects of aging in animal models. Here, we sought to determine whether the high-capacity cytomegalovirus vector can be an effective and safe gene delivery method for two such-protective factors: telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and follistatin (FST). We found that the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) carrying exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or MCMVFST) extended median lifespan by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively. This is the first report of CMV being used successfully as both an intranasal and injectable gene therapy system to extend longevity. Treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance, physical performance, and prevented loss of body mass and alopecia. Telomere shortening seen with aging was ameliorated by TERT, and mitochondrial structure deterioration was halted in both treatments. Intranasal and injectable preparations performed equally well in safely and efficiently delivering gene therapy to multiple organs, with long-lasting benefits and without carcinogenicity or unwanted side effects. Translating this research to humans could have significant benefits associated with increased health span.",48,1624845521,longevity

&gt;Prejudging that the report was purposely constructed to harm the microbiome environment...

I didn't say that they purposely wanted to harm the microbiota and I don't know how you even reached that conclusion. This piece of research was only a minor research outcome from the clinical trial. You can see in the link I posted that it is one of the *secondary* outcome measures, out of a total of 17 outcome measures. Meaning: it's an add on, ""while we're at it"" kind of measure. And we do know what the formula was: Optifast 2 by Nestle Healthcare Nutrition. It says in the other paper that uses the same clinical study - the paper I linked.  

&gt;...by only giving a source of food that cannot support the existing biome, doesn't give any insight whatsoever. 

That's not how it works. Your microbial colonies are in a constant state of flux and any changes in your diet (from different nutrients to different calorie content) will cause changes in your microbiome. The VLCD was never going to support the existing microbiome. It literally couldn't, unless the participants in the study were already drinking the same diet. This is a very nice review that explains it better than I ever could: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385025/

&gt;I mean, they ""could"" have added some fibersol - b in that shake, and that alone should be enough to reject every assumption you said. 

Actually, they can't have supplemented it with anything. The paper would have to mention it. That's how a research paper works. This is what it says:

&gt;In the first 8 wk of the 12-wk CR period, weight loss was assisted by a very low calorie diet (800 kcal/d), replacing all meals with a formula diet (Optifast 2; Nestle ́ Health- Care Nutrition, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) (40). Participants were advised to consume the formula diet exclusively (daily consumption of five packets with 160 kcal each: 20 g of carbohydrates, 14 g of proteins, and 3 g of fat dissolved in 300 ml of water) without consuming any additional food.

(Note that Optifast 2 is meant to be supplemented with food [https://www.optifast.com.au/optifast-vlcd-program/optifast-vlcd-program/program-weight-loss-levels], but this clinical trial specifically advised participants not to have any food.)

&gt;Plus, I am pretty sure that's why the shake was made of the shake was containing high ratio of fiber and carb.

The research doesn't just deal with *quantity* of bacteria but *variety* of bacterial colonies. That's what the ""restructuring"" refers to. It's not about fibre content. Different types of bacteria prefer different nutrients. 


&gt;Could we see a C. Diff in supplements in near future?

There's no need. If you take antibiotics often enough you're already increasing your chances of getting a C. Diff infection. And it can turn nasty. Like fatal, nasty. C. diff normally lives in your digestive system and other gut bacteria keep it in check. Taking antibiotics kills off all sorts of bacteria, and with less competition (and without some antimicrobial chemicals a few bacterial colonies can produce to remove their own competition), C. diff can take over. If you eat less varied food, your microbiota also becomes less varied, since the nutrients you're taking in will suit only certain types of bacteria but not others (again, it's not just fibre). Depending on what kind of bacteria you're left with, they may not be able to push back against it. None of this is new. There's no need for this research paper to state anything about the toxicity of C diff. 

&gt; But I would not jump the gun to ""intentionally disregard"" research that is posted on Nature because ""I think so.""

I provided links to the facts and gave my reasoning - either you didn't look at the links or didn't understand them. The only reasons I replied at all is because I have a personal interest in the human microbiome and how the foods we consume affect our microbiota; and also because there were plenty of people here who mentioned struggling with the scientific language, and I could help with that.

PS: 
&gt;I'd rather say this gives a glimpse of the possibility to explain different energy usage between the individuals. Some do get fat with low-calorie intake and some can be a food fighter and won't gain a pound. Many have accused (or suspected) the microbiome of that difference and this is the first research that explains a part of it.

It wouldn't be the first at all. This has been an area of research for a few years now. Some highly cited papers on the matter:

,IUsedABurnerEmail,"I'm not sure I would consider this study all that reliable in terms of microbiota. 

The summary says they put *women* (not mice, as per the other replies) on a very low calorie diet. Their metabolism became healthier but the amount of bacteria in their gut decreased, with less variety too (not good). The researchers then took their gut bacteria both from before the diet and after the diet, and put it into two sets of mice. This is very common in microbiota studies. They use special mice without their own bacteria, mostly to simplify things and check if the bacteria cause any changes. In this case, the mice with the post-diet bacteria lost weight and fat compared to the mice with the pre-diet (non CR) bacteria. The post-diet bacteria mice lost weight because they weren't absorbing as many nutrients (eg fat) from their food. Nothing wrong with that and so far pretty normal. It happens in lean humans too, where their microbiota extracts less energy from the humans' diet (the opposite is true for overweight individuals). In this study the researchers found that the mice were more vulnerable to C. Diff infection due to a decrease in bile acids. 

------ 

Now this is where I would take issue with this summary (I haven't read the full article):
The CR diet they put the women on is the one also used for this paper: https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/early/2020/05/29/jimmunol.2000108.full.pdf

For the first 8 weeks of the study, the women were only consuming 800kcal/day in the form of a special diet milkshake. That was followed by 4 weeks of CR normal foods, and for another 4 weeks they maintained their weight using a diet at caloric maintenance. And that's the issue here. **If you spend months drinking meals made up from a powder with no variety whatsoever, your gut microbiota will become less diverse.** This is very well known. It's why we are all told to eat a varied diet rich in fruit/veg/wholegrains (the types of food the healthier gut bacterial colonies thrive on). 

It's been observed before that having less variety in your bacterial colonies makes you more susceptible to bacterial infections. You can think of it as a vegetable garden. Your vegetables are plants, and so are the weeds. You tend to the vegetables because you benefit from them, yet the weeds are adapted to be more resilient and easier to spread and multiply everywhere. If you stop looking after your garden (stop eating healthy, varied food) the weeds (pathogenic bacteria) will quickly take over. 

A lot of papers have been published from this particular clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01105143) so maybe this was just an add-on to all the other research, while they were at it anyway.

Despite there being benefits in mice and rats, some think that long term CR could induce unwanted stress effects in humans that could trigger disease, like Roy Walford's ALS.  He also mentions there's risk of gall stones from extended periods of daily fasting.

Valter Longo studied under Roy Walford, who was the large proponent/big name of CR research. Longo's research has led him to the view that short periods of combined protein and calorie restriction have significant benefits without downsides of long term CR. The research index I link to is a reasonable starting point, but Longo's book also goes into the history at higher level. There are plenty of interviews on youtube with him also.

 We really don't know how long term CR effects people with different genetic backgrounds/risk. It's an on-going area of research. Roy Walford did CR for years and then died from ALS at 79. It's partly what motivated Longo to find out whether the same pathways could be activated without long term stress.  

Here's some recent research on different responses to CR by the Buck Institute: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200604152113.htm

For fasting and age related disease there's a 5 day intervention designed by biogerontologists who think it's preferable to chronic calorie restriction because the stress is limited to 4-5 days, see /r/FMD (note the sidebar, and /r/FMD/wiki/index).

&gt;Aging is the leading risk factor for several age-associated diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the biology of aging mechanisms is essential to the pursuit of brain health. In this regard, brain aging is defined by a gradual decrease in neurophysiological functions, impaired adaptive neuroplasticity, dysregulation of neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, neuroinflammation, and oxidatively modified molecules and organelles. Numerous pathways lead to brain aging, including increased oxidative stress, inflammation, disturbances in energy metabolism such as deregulated autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and IGF-1, mTOR, ROS, AMPK, SIRTs, and p53 as central modulators of the metabolic control, connecting aging to the pathways, which lead to neurodegenerative disorders. Also, calorie restriction (CR), physical exercise, and mental activities can extend lifespan and increase nervous system resistance to age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. The neuroprotective effect of CR involves increased protection against ROS generation, maintenance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and inhibition of apoptosis. The recent evidence about the modem molecular and cellular methods in neurobiology to brain aging is exhibiting a significant potential in brain cells for adaptation to aging and resistance to neurodegenerative disorders.",2,1624169774,longevity

&gt; 
&gt; Geriatricians and others must embrace the emerging field of geroscience. Until recently geroscience research was pursued in laboratory animals, but now this field requires specialized expertise in the care of vulnerable older patients with multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, the population likely to benefit the most from emerging therapies. While chronological aging measures the inevitable passage of clock time that occurs equally for everyone, biological aging varies among individuals, and importantly, it is modifiable. Advances in our understanding of biological aging, the discovery of strategies for modifying its rate, and an appreciation of aging as a shared risk factor for chronic diseases have jointly led to the Geroscience Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that interventions modifying aging biology can slow its progression-resulting in the delay or prevention of the onset of multiple diseases and disorders. Here we wish to report on the Third Geroscience Summit held at National Institutes of Health on November 4-5, 2019, which highlighted the importance of engaging other disciplines including clinicians. Involvement by scientists with expertise in clinical trials, health outcomes research, behavioral and social sciences, health policy, and economics is urgently needed to translate geroscience discoveries from the bench to clinical care and health policy. **Adding to the urgency of broadening this geroscience coalition is the emergence of biological aging as one the most important modifiable factors of COVID-19, combined with the inability of our society to once again recognize and confront aging as a priority and opportunity when facing these types of public health emergencies**.

These results indicate that L1 activation contributes to the pathologies of SIRT6 knockout mice. Similarly, L1 transcription, cytoplasmic cDNA copy number and type I interferons were elevated in the wild type aged mice. As sterile inflammation is a hallmark of aging we propose that modulating L1 activity may be an important strategy for attenuating age-related pathologies.""

&gt; **Background**

&gt; Residential environments are associated with older adult health, but underlying physiologic causal mechanisms are not well understood. As adults age, street blocks are likely more relevant to their health than the larger neighborhood environment. This study examined the effects of adverse street block conditions on aging biomarkers among older adults.

&gt; **Methods**  

&gt; We included community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 67 and older with 2017 biomarker data from the nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study (n=4,357).  

&gt; Street block disorder in 2016 was measured using interviewer report of any trash/glass/litter, graffiti, or vacant buildings on participants’ blocks. 

&gt; Propensity score models were used to create balanced groups with regard to multiple 2015 participant characteristics, including demographic, socioeconomic, residence, and early life characteristics.  

&gt; Linear regressions modeled street block disorder as a predictor of four aging biomarkers, hemoglobin A1C, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and cytomegalovirus antibodies, before and after applying propensity score weighting.

&gt; **Results**

&gt; Adjusting for participant sociodemographic characteristics and applying propensity score weights, living on a block with any disorder was associated with 2% higher mean hemoglobin A1C levels (95% CI: 0.002-0.03), 13% higher C-reactive protein (95% CI: 0.03-0.23), 10% higher interleukin-6 (95% CI: 0.02-0.19), and 19% more cytomegalovirus antibodies (95% CI: 0.09-0.29) compared to living on a block with no disorder.

&gt; **Conclusions**

&gt; Street block disorder predicted subsequent aging biomarkers after applying a propensity score approach to account for confounding among a national sample of older adults.

,chromosomalcrossover,"&gt; Background

&gt; The difference between an individual's chronological and DNA methylation predicted age (DNAmAge), termed DNAmAge acceleration (DNAmAA), can capture life-long environmental exposures and age-related physiological changes reflected in methylation status. Several studies have linked DNAmAA to morbidity and mortality, yet its relationship with kidney function has not been assessed. We evaluated the associations between seven DNAm aging and lifespan predictors (as well as GrimAge components) and five kidney traits (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [uACR], serum urate, microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease [CKD]) in up to 9688 European, African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals from seven population-based studies.

&gt; Results

&gt; We identified 23 significant associations in our large trans-ethnic meta-analysis (p &lt; 1.43E−03 and consistent direction of effect across studies). Age acceleration measured by the Extrinsic and PhenoAge estimators, as well as Zhang’s 10-CpG epigenetic mortality risk score (MRS), were associated with all parameters of poor kidney health (lower eGFR, prevalent CKD, higher uACR, microalbuminuria and higher serum urate). Six of these associations were independently observed in European and African American populations. MRS in particular was consistently associated with eGFR (β =  − 0.12, 95% CI = [− 0.16, − 0.08] change in log-transformed eGFR per unit increase in MRS, p = 4.39E−08), prevalent CKD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 [1.47, 2.16], p = 2.71E-09) and higher serum urate levels (β = 0.12 [0.07, 0.16], p = 2.08E−06). The “first-generation” clocks (Hannum, Horvath) and GrimAge showed different patterns of association with the kidney traits. Three of the DNAm-estimated components of GrimAge, namely adrenomedullin, plasminogen-activation inhibition 1 and pack years, were positively associated with higher uACR, serum urate and microalbuminuria.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; DNAmAge acceleration and DNAm mortality predictors estimated in whole blood were associated with multiple kidney traits, including eGFR and CKD, in this multi-ethnic study. Epigenetic biomarkers which reflect the systemic effects of age-related mechanisms such as immunosenescence, inflammaging and oxidative stress may have important mechanistic or prognostic roles in kidney disease.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; In the current literature, the definitions of aging range from relying on certain sets of distinctive features at the molecular, organismal, populational and/or even evolutional levels/scales to declaring it a treatable disease and, moreover, to treating aging as a mental construct rather than a natural phenomenon.  

&gt; One reason of such a mess may be that it is common in the natural sciences to disregard philosophy of science where several categories of definitions are recognized, among which the nominal are less, and the so-called real ones are more appropriate in scientific contexts. E.g., water is, by its nominal definition, a liquid having certain observable features and, by its real definition, a specific combination (or a product of interaction) of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Noteworthy, the real definition is senseless for people ignorant of atoms. Likewise, the nominal definition of aging as a set of observable features should be supplemented, if not replaced, with its real definition. The latter is suggested here to imply that aging is the product of chemical interactions between the rapidly turning-over free metabolites and the slowly turning-over metabolites incorporated in macromolecules involved in metabolic control.  

&gt; The phenomenon defined in this way emerged concomitantly with metabolic pathways controlled by enzymes coded for by information-storing macromolecules and is inevitable wherever such conditions coincide. Aging research, thus, is concerned with the elucidation of the pathways and mechanisms that link aging defined as above to its hallmarks and manifestations, including those comprised by its nominal definitions.

Using messenger rna to make vaccines was an unproven idea. But if it worked, the technique would revolutionise medicine, not least by providing protection against infectious diseases and biological weapons. So in 2013 America’s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa) gambled. It awarded a small, new firm called Moderna $25m to develop the idea. Eight years, and more than 175m doses later, Moderna’s covid-19 vaccine sits alongside weather satellites, gps, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which darpa can claim at least partial credit.  
  
  
  
It is the agency that shaped the modern world, and this success has spurred imitators. In America there are arpas for homeland security, intelligence and energy, as well as the original defence one. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $6.5bn to set up a health version, which will, the president vows, “end cancer as we know it”. His administration also has plans for another, to tackle climate change. Germany has recently established two such agencies: one civilian (the Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation, or sprin-d) and another military (the Cybersecurity Innovation Agency). Japan’s interpretation is called Moonshot r&amp;d. In Britain a bill for an Advanced Research and Invention Agency—often referred to as uk arpa—is making its way through Parliament.  
  
An agency needs agency  
As governments across the rich world begin, after a four-decade lull, to spend more on research and development, the idea of an agency to invent the future (and, in so doing, generate vast industries) is alluring and, the success of darpa suggests, no mere fantasy. In many countries there is displeasure with the web of bureaucracy that entangles funding systems, and hope that the darpa model can provide a way of getting around it. But as some have discovered, and others soon will, copying darpa requires more than just copying the name. It also needs commitment to the principles which made the original agency so successful—principles that are often uncomfortable for politicians.  
  
On paper, the approach is straightforward. Take enormous, reckless gambles on things so beneficial that only a handful need work to make the whole venture a success. As Arun Majumdar, founding director of arpa-e, America’s energy agency, puts it: “If every project is succeeding, you’re not trying hard enough.” Current (unclassified) darpa projects include mimicking insects’ nervous systems in order to reduce the computation required for artificial intelligence and working out how to protect soldiers from the enemy’s use of genome-editing technologies.  
  
The result is a mirror image of normal r&amp;d agencies. Whereas most focus on basic research, darpa builds things. Whereas most use peer review and carefully selected measurements of progress, darpa strips bureaucracy to the bones (the conversation in 1965 which led the agency to give out $1m for the first cross-country computer network, a forerunner to the internet, took just 15 minutes). All work is contracted out. darpa has a boss, a small number of office directors and fewer than 100 programme managers, hired on fixed short-term contracts, who act in a manner akin to venture capitalists, albeit with the aim of generating specific outcomes rather than private returns.  
  
The first challenge for the new arpas is to secure the breathing space required for such experimentation. sprin-d illustrates how difficult this can be. The concept was approved by Germany’s cabinet—“and then the Federal Court of Auditors came along,” sighs Barbara Diehl, sprin-d’s chief partnership officer. After the auditors issued their recommendations, the agency lost its exemption from standard public-sector procurement rules and pay scales, restricting who it could hire and the sorts of risks it could take. Existing government ministries exert influence through the agency’s board, stymying radicalism, says Ms Diehl. Dominic Cummings, a former aide to Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, who demanded a British agency as a condition of his employment, has said he is concerned by the provisions for ministerial oversight in the legislation creating it.  
  
Without freedom from political interference, the risk-taking instincts of those at the cutting edge are curbed. The administrative and research directors of Germany’s Cybersecurity Innovation Agency recently quit, frustrated by political interference. In America the homeland-security arpa was established in 2002, but has been hamstrung by power struggles in the department that gave it its name. “It has never been allowed to make independent decisions, it has never been allowed an independent budget,” says an observer. There is a debate about whether the Biden administration’s health arpa (arpa-h) ought to stand alone, or be part of the National Institutes of Health (nih). The latter would be less of a legislative challenge, but may infringe its independence.",3,1623030634,longevity

One was “If doctors developed a pill that enabled you to live forever at your current age, would you take it?” The possible answers were yes, no, or unsure.

We are better at curing cancer and treating diseases, so more people make it to old age and old people with health problems are more likely to recover faster/better/stronger than ever before.

&gt; 2: Emphasize the real purpose of rejuvenation, which is to ensure good health at all ages, not to prolong poor health into old age, as medicine does today.

This point is critical - currently medicine for age-related diseases is a failure and this should not be sugar coated. The aging bio field *has* to differentiate itself from the current approach to medicine in this manner, because it promises to bring about a new paradigm

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

&gt; Elizabeth Blackburn, a biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, who won the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, in 2009, cofounded Telomere Diagnostics in 2010. The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

&gt; Elissa Epel, another UCSF researcher who cofounded the company with Blackburn, left at the same time for the same reasons.

&gt; Both researchers told Business Insider that they questioned the efficacy of Telomere Diagnostics' test. And a former Telomere Diagnostics employee said she witnessed practices that raised doubts about the company's cleanliness, commitment to scientific accuracy, and handling of private health information.

&gt;  the links between telomere length, health, and aging are not yet clear cut.

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been tied to higher rates of disease, faster tumor growth, and overall age-related degeneration. But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal. That means that we still do not fully understand telomeres or their role in aging and disease.

Abstract:

&gt;White spot lesions (WSL) and incipient caries on enamel surfaces are the earliest clinical outcomes for demineralization and caries. If left untreated, the caries can progress and may cause complex restorative procedures or even tooth extraction which destroys soft and hard tissue architecture as a consequence of connective tissue and bone loss. Current clinical practices are insufficient in treating dental caries. A long-standing practical challenge associated with demineralization related to dental diseases is incorporating a functional mineral microlayer which is fully integrated into the molecular structure of the tooth in repairing damaged enamel. **This study demonstrates that small peptide domains derived from native protein amelogenin can be utilized to construct a mineral layer on damaged human enamel in vitro. Six groups were prepared to carry out remineralization on artificially created lesions on enamel: (1) no treatment, (2) Ca2+ and PO43– only, (3) 1100 ppm fluoride (F), (4) 20 000 ppm F, (5) 1100 ppm F and peptide, and (6) peptide alone. While the 1100 ppm F sample (indicative of common F content of toothpaste for homecare) did not deliver F to the thinly deposited mineral layer, high F test sample (indicative of clinical varnish treatment) formed mainly CaF2 nanoparticles on the surface. Fluoride, however, was deposited in the presence of the peptide, which also formed a thin mineral layer which was partially crystallized as fluorapatite. Among the test groups, only the peptide-alone sample resulted in remineralization of fairly thick (10 μm) dense mineralized layer containing HAp mineral, resembling the structure of the healthy enamel.

,PocketMatt,"This paper quantifies physical activity in **min/week** and relies on a qualitative distinction between moderate and high intensity aerobic activity.

&gt;performing three to five times the recommended physical activity (450-750 min/week) reaches the maximal healthspan benefit

This approach is more accessible, but less useful than [MET/h per week](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-are-mets). As some of the other commenters have shown, the min/week calculation would suggest that we aim for 12.5 hours of physical activity per week (or nearly two hours per day).

Happily, if we quantify exercise intensity with METs, we get a different picture. The claim of 750 min/week references a [2019 review article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640736) that references this 2015 meta-analysis: [Leisure Time Physical Activity and Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4451435/). Per **Figure 1** of that paper, the maximal risk reduction was observed between **22.5** and **40 MET/h per week**. That corresponds to 3x to 5x the recommended level of physical activity, and it's the basis for the 450-750 min/week claim.

Pulling METs from the [Compendium of Physical Activities](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/), it becomes clear that reaching even the highest of the specified range (i.e. 40 MET/h per week) is quite feasible. I picked a few activities from the Compendium and compiled them below:

|Activity|MET|Hours to Reach 40 MET|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Walking, 3.0 mph|3.0|13.3|
|Cycling, 10 to 12 mph|6.0|6.7|
|Tennis|7.3|5.5|
|Ultimate Frisbee|8.0|5.0|
|Running, 6 mph|9.8|4.1|
|Cycling, 14 to 16 mph|10.0|4.0|
|Running Up Stairs|15.0|2.7|

Another point worth mentioning: per this meta-analysis, increases in exercise volume have diminishing returns.

|MET/h Per Week|Reduction in Mortality Risk|Risk Reduction Per MET/h|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0 - &lt; 7.5|20%|2.6%|
|7.5 - &lt; 15|31%|1.5%|
|15 - &lt; 22.5|37%|0.8%|
|22.5 - &lt; 40|39%|0.1%|

Given that most of us are motivated to extend life because we enjoy life, it's probably worthwhile to reflect on the value of squeezing out 0.1% risk reductions. To me, the longevity value of exercise is saturated before that point. Especially when considering the risk of injury.

Lastly, it's probably not a coincidence that the sports with the greatest observed reductions in mortality are social (rather than solitary): [Various Leisure-Time Physical Activities Associated With Widely Divergent Life Expectancies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961830538X):

The social interactions tap into other factors that promote longevity (e.g. belonging). **So, if you're trying to exercise (aerobically) to improve your healthspan and lifespan, the evidence suggests that four to five hours a week of activities like tennis or ultimate frisbee would do the trick.**",2,1622216496,longevity
,Strict_Cup_8379,"**Conclusion**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Here, we have discussed how instead of cutting calories, changing the composition of the diet – in particular, altering the levels of dietary protein or of specific dietary amino acids – may be a translatable and sustainable method to promote healthy aging.  
&gt;  
&gt;An emerging consensus of animal and human data suggests that, contrary to long-held popular beliefs, lower protein consumption is more beneficial for health and longevity than high protein consumption. Recent human studies have found that lower protein intake is correlated with improved metabolic health as well as increased longevity, while a high protein intake correlates with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...It is now becoming clear that dietary protein quality – the specific amino acid composition of the dietary protein – has a profound effect on metabolic health and longevity in mammals. In this review, we have discussed current knowledge on how dietary amino acids can affect metabolic health and longevity. These include studies demonstrating that restriction of methionine, BCAAs or tryptophan can improve healthspan and lifespan in rodents. While only a few human studies on these types of diets have been conducted, preliminary evidence suggests that restriction of methionine or BCAAs may also have metabolic benefits in humans. Data from rodents already suggests that the age of initiation of methionine or BCAA restriction, as well as the degree of restriction, will influence the ultimate effect of these diets \[111,112,217\]. As with PR, long-term clinical trials will be critical to determining if restriction of specific dietary amino acids – and which ones, and when – can promote healthy aging in humans....",2,1622215528,longevity

&gt;  
&gt;As a key macronutrient and source of essential macromolecules, dietary protein plays a significant role in health. For many years, protein-rich diets have been recommended as healthy due to the satiety-inducing and muscle-building effects of protein, as well as the ability of protein calories to displace allegedly unhealthy calories from fats and carbohydrates. However, **clinical studies find that consumption of dietary protein is associated with an increased risk of multiple diseases, especially diabetes**, while **studies in rodents have demonstrated that protein restriction can promote metabolic health and even lifespan.** Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of dietary protein on health and longevity are not mediated simply by protein quantity but are instead mediated by protein quality – **the specific amino acid composition of the diet.**Here, we discuss how **dietary protein and specific amino acids including methionine, the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), tryptophan and glycine regulate metabolic health, healthspan, and aging**, with attention to the specific molecular mechanisms that may participate in these effects. Finally, we discuss the potential applicability of these findings to promoting healthy aging in humans.",1,1622214510,longevity

Abstract  
In every population across the world, women live significantly longer than men; however, **the underlying physiological processes that drive these sex differences in age-specific mortality are largely unknown**. Recently, the role of adipose tissue in aging and longevity has been a focus of biomedical research in both humans and rodent models. Specifically, brown adipose tissue, a thermoregulatory tissue originally thought to not exist past infancy in humans, has been shown to potentially play a role in health throughout the lifespan. **Females have larger adult brown adipose depots that are not just larger in size but also more efficient in non-shivering thermogenesis**. This improved functioning of the brown adipose tissue may potentially lead to improved female health, and we hypothesize that this advantage may be of even bigger significance in the older population. Here, **we briefly review what is known about sex differences in aging and how sex differences in brown adipose tissue may be contributing to the female lifespan advantage.** These questions have usually been addressed in large experimental studies in rodents as a translational model of human aging. Overall, we propose that a better understanding of the thermogenesis-metabolism nexus is necessary in biomedical research, and sex differences in these factors may contribute to the female longevity bias seen in human populations.",5,1621779174,longevity

,Bullshirting,"Text from PDF:

As we age, our vulnerability to both chronic and infectious disease increases a thousand fold. Chronic pain, dementia, and cancer aren’t much of a concern when we’re young, but with age such maladies appear in rapid succession. Research into the mechanisms of aging has identified underlying processes for this vulnerability, and targeting these processes both extends life and delays the onset of all these diseases. Identifying therapies that change processes of aging in humans thus represents the biggest lever our race has on health and disease. The field is poised for radical impact, but making this reality will take a lot of effort.

The Longevity Apprentice role is for people who want to play a part in that, but aren’t sure how.

What will you be doing?

Broadly, you’ll be contributing to the design and promotion of projects to accelerate thedevelopment of treatments for aging. This might include turning bullet point arguments into atwo-page proposal, compiling every study linking aging mechanisms to a disease, summarizingideas in infographics and slides, improving the online visibility of our work, and more. You mayalso continue to be involved in projects as they get off the ground.

What you spend the most time on depends on what skills you bring to the table, and will varywith time. Your time commitment has flexibility, but will likely be 5-20 hours each week.You’ll be guided by Martin Borch Jensen, who after a career in academic aging researchfounded Gordian Biotechnology, combining gene therapy and systems biology to dissect agingand age-related disease. You’ll meet with Martin weekly to set strategy, but will spendconsiderable time working independently. You may also work alongside other Longevity Apprentices, and/or external collaborators.

How will you grow?

- You will learn first-hand what it takes to plan and launch important projects in biotech.

- You will be trained to understand the promise and limitations of studies on aging.

- You will be forced to make decisions independently, with feedback on outcomes.

- You will be introduced to a network of scientists, entrepreneurs &amp; investors in longevity.

- You will be championed in your own projects, and/or in joining the ones you help design.

Sound interesting?

You can submit a brief application here. Applications will be evaluated on a rolling basis.You’ll be a good fit if you’re proactive and a clear thinker, even if you’re early in yourcareer/training. Experience in biology and/or writing will be useful, but not essential. You canwork remotely, so geographical location is not a barrier to your application. The apprenticeshipis paid, though not handsomely. Don’t do it for the money.",9,1620999976,longevity

Get these incentives right and you might go some way to solving the problem.

e.g. In the UK health care is publically funded and publically provided by one organisation - the NHS. In Israel health care is publically funded but provided by four non profit public health funds, which people can switch between once per year, so the public health funds are competing with each other. Guess which country had a faster and more efficient COVID-19 vaccine roll out?

In the US the FDA sets the rules, then also runs clinical trials (continually checking that they are up to scratch) along with the companies want to test and sell drugs. Perhaps the FDA could just decide on a few safety standards and rules, and then four public test companies could compete for business on time, speed of decision making, transparency of decision making etc and the medical companies could pick from using these four test partner companies?",5,1620203378,longevity

**1** Is the conventional method for human blood plasma donation:

* [ in terms of replacement solution ... albumin versus saline solution ] 

* [ amount taken ...50% with mice vs ~20% of blood plasma in a typical donation every two weeks ] 

... similar enough to what's being indicated in the studies involving dilution of blood plasma?


**2**  Are there any studies on regular human blood plasma donors on whether there might be any signficant health benefit? 

I'm aware of the Healthy Donor Effect (HDE) as described in this 2017 paper where it's argued there is a self-selection bias amongst donors who are healthier to begin with more likely to continue as longterm donors: 


**Associations of health status with subsequent blood donor behavior—An alternative perspective on the Healthy Donor Effect from Donor InSight**

Published online 2017 Oct 19. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0186662

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5648214/ 

However that was done with Dutch plasma donors where I believe like Japan, blood donation is exclusively non-commercial [ the monopoly is entrusted to the Red Cross ]. The US, I discovered, has commercial blood banks where donors are financially incentivised with cash compensation; they not only get paid between $30 to $50 per donation, instead of a waiting period of two weeks between donations, it seems that many who are doing it for financial benefit, donate twice a week. My point is that for many of these donors who are doing it for the money, the HDE seems less likely to exist. 

It's possible that a conventional 600mL blood plasma donation [ roughly 20% of total blood plasma ] done every two or three weeks , might produce a meaningful plasma dilution / regeneration effect. 

**ETA**   I recently did a plasma donation of 600mL. I paid attention to both pre-donation and post-donation nutrition &amp; supplementation [ i.e.  no medications 48 hours before donation, and post-donation, foods or supplements high in D3, K2 MK-7 (they gave me plenty of Ca supplements during and after ), B12, B2 , B1, methylfolate, C, Zn, Mg, K, etc. )",1,1620186777,longevity

,hobbitlover,"GDP sucks for a lot of good reasons.

One is that it depends on endless growth and constantly increasing productivity, and becomes a kind of pyramid scheme after a while. Countries like Canada are trying to pump up their population growth numbers so they can print more money and pretend that the GDP is growing because of something the country is doing right. Politicians hang their hats on GDP growth because it lets them grow their national debts with deficit spending while still claiming to shrink the ""GDP per capita"" ratio.

Another reasons is that GDP doesn't measure how people are actually doing. We get an idea of how much money is changing hands and the size of the economy, but it doesn't really say much about quality of life or anything that really matters to people. In that way it's completely disconnected from reality in that the GDP can continue to grow while wages stagnate and unemployment stays high.

It also encourages recklessness. Continually growing the GDP is short-term thinking. It encourages environmentally destructive behaviours like clear cutting, strip mining, overfishing and other forms of resource depletion. It encourages the sale of industries and resources to foreign companies and powers, and ongoing trade relationships with hostile foreign powers like China - countries that should be shunned by the world right now but won't be because we can't financially afford to take a moral stand. If it's bad for the Dow and reduces GDP, then it doesn't happen. Regulations to protect workers, consumers and the environment are the enemy of GDP growth.

There are a lot of other reasons why we need to stop using the GDP as a measure of development, but one that sticks out is the way that GDP grows faster for the wrong reasons. War is good for business. Natural disasters are good for business. Subsidies to industries that distort the market are good for business. Vices like alcohol and tobacco sales are good for business. It doesn't matter that these industries are sometimes propped up by growing national deficits, the GDP still grows - it doesn't care where the money came from or what the impact of that borrowing will be on future generations. 

It's time to ditch the GDP and start measuring things that matter - wages, housing affordability, new business starts, the number of listed companies on exchanges, individual satisfaction or happiness, opportunities to work and grow, high school, post-secondary and grad school graduation rates, longevity, child poverty, senior poverty, health care wait times and outcomes, the number of per capita parks, environmental sustainability, our ability to turn resources into value-added products instead of shipping out raw materials, and so on. There are some indexes that do a better job of measuring things than the GDP, but honestly the best alternative model I've seen is Doughnut Economics - the only sustainable economic models I've seen that doesn't rely on growing the population to the point of collapse.",2,1619650592,longevity

&gt;The US still lost more people to COVID than WW2 or 9/11.
  
The US is a state organization. Also, we don't know how many people died of Covid. Now apply some utilitarian analysis, how many people died of cancer because they didn't go to the doctor? How many of suicide? How many lives were damaged due to loss of work? etc. 
    
This isn't a one variable analysis. 
    
&gt;Makeshift or tent hospitals certainly did not fully and uniformly meet capacity and specialty equipment needs, for either public or private hospitals.
    
Few were even used. Go look at ICU capacity in 2019 vs 2020 and compare months. ICUs are almost always at high capacity.

If the utilitarian public good is deemed greater by holding online classes for a year, that's that.

And small is relative. The US still lost more people to COVID than WW2 or 9/11. That was WITH preventative guidelines. Accounting for all of the sickness that didn't lead to death, the suffering and the long COVID symptoms we may never fully characterize, COVID is hardly just some overhyped flu. Additionally numerous health systems suspended elective surgeries precisely due to lack of bandwidth. Makeshift or tent hospitals certainly did not fully and uniformly meet capacity and specialty equipment needs, for either public or private hospitals.

&gt; 
The microbiome plays a fundamental role in the maturation, function, and regulation of the host-immune system from birth to old age. In return, the immune system has co-evolved a mutualistic relationship with trillions of beneficial microbes residing our bodies while mounting efficient responses to fight invading pathogens. As we age, both the immune system and the gut microbiome undergo significant changes in composition and function that correlate with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and reduced vaccination responses.  

&gt; Emerging studies suggest that targeting age-related dysbiosis can improve health- and lifespan, in part through reducing systemic low-grade inflammation and immunosenescence—two hallmarks of the aging process. However—a cause and effect relationship of age-related dysbiosis and associated functional declines in immune cell functioning have yet to be demonstrated in clinical settings.

&gt; Several studies claimed C60 fullerenes as a prospective geroprotector drug due to their ability to capture free radicals effectively and caused a profound interest in C60 in life extension communities. Multiple additives are already sold for human consumption despite a small body of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of fullerenes on the lifespan. In order to test the effect of C60 fullerenes on lifespan and healthspan, we administered C60 fullerenes dissolved in virgin olive oil orally to 10-12 months old CBA/Ca mice of both genders for seven months and assessed their survival.  

&gt; To uncover C60 and virgin olive effects, we established two control groups: mice treated with virgin olive oil (vehicle) and mice treated with drinking water. To measure healthspan, we conducted daily monitoring of health condition and lethality and monthly bodyweight measurements. We also assessed physical activity, glucose metabolism, and hematological parameters every three months. We did not observe health deterioration in the animals treated with C60 compared with the control groups. 

&gt; Treatment of mice with C60 fullerenes resulted in an increased lifespan of males and females compared with the olive oil-treated animals. **The lifespan of C60-treated mice was similar to the mice treated with water.**

Apr 7, 2021 - (AP) — More than a half million Americans have taken advantage of the Biden administration’s special health insurance sign-up window keyed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government announced Wednesday in anticipation that even more consumers will gain coverage in the coming months. The reason officials expect sign-ups to keep growing is that millions of people became eligible effective Apr. 1 for pumped-up subsidies toward their premiums under President Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief legislation. The special sign-up opportunity for Affordable Care Act plans will be available until Aug. 15. Biden campaigned on a strategy of building on the Obama-era health law to push the United States toward coverage for all. As president, he’s wasted no time.

according to a new peer-reviewed study by Environmental Working Group.

https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/7/3332/htm

For the study, published March 24 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Environmental Working Group (EWG) researchers used data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxicity Forecaster, or ToxCast,

https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-01/documents/toxcast_factsheet_dec2018.pdf

This finding is of particular concern during the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; The World Health Organization designated the decade 2020–2030 as the “decade of healthy ageing.” It is a tragic irony that the year 2020 should begin with a pandemic that is so lethal for older persons. Not only are older persons the most vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality, but many of the mitigation efforts to slow the spread of the virus have imposed yet further emotional and mental health burdens on the most vulnerable among those older than 70 years. To help prevent future infectious disease mortality and suffering, as well as the profound health burdens from the chronic diseases associated with ageing, insights from biogerontology must become an integral part of global public health priorities. The timing is ripe for making the public health aspiration of developing an applied gerontological intervention a reality.

,StoicOptom,"&gt; Abstract

&gt; The International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research Task Force met in March 2020, in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, to discuss strategies for advancing the interdisciplinary field of geroscience. Geroscience explores biological mechanisms of aging as targets for intervention that may delay the physiological consequences of aging, maintain function, and prevent frailty and disability. Priorities for clinical practice and research include identifying and validating a range of biomarkers of the hallmarks of aging. Potential biomarkers discussed included markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, proteostasis, stem cell dysfunction, nutrient sensing, genomic instability, telomere dysfunction, cellular senescence, and epigenetic changes. The FRAILOMICS initiative is exploring many of these through various omics studies. Translating this knowledge into new therapies is being addressed by the U.S. National Institute on Aging Translational Gerontology Branch. Research gaps identified by the Task Force include the need for improved cellular and animal models as well as more reliable and sensitive measures.

Didn't expect this paper to open with a note on COVID-19, but the silver lining of this pandemic for the aging field was the ease at which the vulnerability of our aging population can be highlighted when explaining the importance of aging biology in medicine: 

The International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research (ICFSR) Task Force met in Toulouse, France on March 10, 2020 to discuss geroscience. The timing could not have been more prescient: On the following day, March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (1). The disease, caused by a virus known as SARS-CoV2, had at that point already claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people in 114 countries, with the risk of morbidity and mortality especially elevated in older people and those with underlying medical conditions (2).

Why older adults are particularly vulnerable to this novel virus remains poorly understood. Age-related physiological changes including immune senescence, the high incidence of chronic illnesses, and frailty may decrease resilience and increase susceptibility to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and infectious diseases (3). Older adults may also present atypically, further complicating diagnosis and treatment (4).",1,1617411964,longevity

But there are many more examples. Just look at the competition for university places or jobs in China and India.

&gt; The blood–brain barrier (BBB) protects the central nervous system (CNS) from unregulated exposure to the blood and its contents.

The cells forming the BBB communicate with cells of the brain and in the periphery. This highly regulated interface changes with healthy aging.

That's the wrong instinct. DeGrey hasn't claimed to have slowed aging down, or that he personally has undergone any treatment that would make him appear young than he is. He's saying that within fifteen years we will have therapies that can \*reverse\* aspects of aging, making older people biologically young again. He may be wrong about whether those therapies will extend life indefinitely, but he is ABSOLUTELY right that they are coming, that they are coming soon, and that they will usher in a revolution in health.",1,1615804795,longevity
,BenVenkman,"Back in the day it was very common for people to think DeGrey was, if not exactly a crank, irresponsibly optimistic about the probability for near term success in his field. There were reasons for this. It's unusual for scientists to make highly specific and overtly dramatic predictions about near term outcomes, and of course the big idea he was proposing (that aging is the result of the accumulation of damage and that the steps necessary to repair that damage were already well understood) was theoretical and had not been demonstrated in the laboratory. In 2005 these criticisms reached their apex when Technology Review actually ran a competition calling for submissions that would demonstrate SENS was ""so wrong as to be unworthy of learned debate"". Three of the submissions were published, but nobody claimed the $20,000 dollar prize money.

Since then criticism of DeGrey has died down considerably. In 2013 a very important paper was published called 'The Hallmarks of Aging' ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/#:\~:text=These%20hallmarks%20are%3A%20genomic%20instability,exhaustion%2C%20and%20altered%20intercellular%20communication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/#:~:text=These%20hallmarks%20are%3A%20genomic%20instability,exhaustion%2C%20and%20altered%20intercellular%20communication)), which basically concurred with everything DeGrey had been saying all along. In 2021, though he remains an eccentric campaigner, his ideas are more or less mainstream. What's more, his damage repair approach to age related ill health is being regularly vindicated in the lab. Among other innovations, the destruction of senescent cells is being shown to have enormous health benefits, and enzymes are being discovered to selectively break glucosepane crosslinks (which lead to things like arterial stiffening and wrinkles). In fact, all seven of the categories of aging DeGrey has previously described are currently the target of rapidly maturing, completely serious experimental interventions, and several of these projects have been spun off into private companies. At this point, while any number of these projects may still stumble along the way, that the model DeGrey advocated for is correct is a settled question. 

What remains unsettled is his optimism as concerns timeframes. We shall see, but there's cause for sober optimism there as well. Of note, other (typically more circumspect) luminaries in the field keep inching closer to agreeing with him publicly, and their confidence grows every year. At this stage I think it's very likely someone like David Sinclair, for instance, is in full agreement with DeGrey. While he has certainly avoided promising anything like DeGrey's 1000 year life spans, he is now publicly saying that he believes most people currently alive should live well into their 120's unless something goes terribly wrong.

Telomere length is a complex subject:

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

&gt; Elizabeth Blackburn, a biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, who won the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, in 2009, cofounded Telomere Diagnostics in 2010. The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

&gt; Elissa Epel, another UCSF researcher who cofounded the company with Blackburn, left at the same time for the same reasons.

&gt; Both researchers told Business Insider that they questioned the efficacy of Telomere Diagnostics' test. And a former Telomere Diagnostics employee said she witnessed practices that raised doubts about the company's cleanliness, commitment to scientific accuracy, and handling of private health information.

&gt;  the links between telomere length, health, and aging are not yet clear cut.

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been tied to higher rates of disease, faster tumor growth, and overall age-related degeneration. But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal.

&gt; In 2010, the American Heart Association defined the construct of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) as the simultaneous presence of 7 ideal health factors: healthy diet, absence of smoking, healthy body mass index (BMI), and optimal levels of physical activity, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and total cholesterol. Higher levels of CVH have been prospectively associated with greater longevity and healthy longevity, as well as markedly lower incidence of chronic diseases related to aging. Higher CVH is also associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular disease.

&gt; DNA methylation markers of aging have been aggregated into a composite epigenetic age score, which is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, it is unknown whether poor CVH is associated with acceleration of aging as measured by DNA methylation markers in epigenetic age. Thus we performed a cross-sectional analysis of racially/ethnically diverse post-menopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative cohort recruited between 1993 and 1998. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) was calculated using DNA methylation data on a subset of participants and the published Horvath and Hannum methods for intrinsic and extrinsic EAA. CVH was calculated using the AHA measures of CVH contributing to a 7-point score.

&gt; We examined the association between CVH score and EAA adjusting for self-reported race/ethnicity and education. Among the 2,170 participants analyzed, mean age was 64 (7 SD) years. Higher or more favorable CVH scores were associated with lower extrinsic EAA (6 months younger age per 1 point higher CVH score), and lower intrinsic EAA (3 months younger age per 1 point higher CVH score). This work provides initial evidence for epigenetic age acceleration to be considered as a potential early detection biomarker for CVH. Future studies are needed to evaluate if measures to promote optimal CVH through lifestyle and behavioral interventions could substantially alter an individual's epigenetic signature and the clinical utility of such a signature",1,1615378590,longevity

It is disappointing that the trend of media, particularly Western media, is oriented toward the acceptance of aging and its underlying symptoms.


We are told time and time again, through movies and TV shows especially, that there is no way to stop the inevitable ticking clock of life, and worse, to instead, in some shape or form, embrace it.
Simply put, aging is a disease and it should be treated as one. Rather than spending countless years tackling each individual ailment associated with aging, let’s rather look at the root cause of aging itself. This is where my research into human biology has led me, and the very problem I aim to overcome.

Fortunately, an increasing number of scientists are making impressive advancements in this field and the future of old age finally finds itself on a ticking clock.

There is still plenty of work that needs to be done, particularly in the form of awareness for the problem we are facing. Added to this, the science behind it must move forward in a deliberate and conscientious way.

Metabolomics was  performed by a combination of chromatographic and mass spectrometric  methods, yielding a total of 1.637.227 measurements. Akk had major  effects on metabolism, causing an increase in spermidine and other  polyamines in the gut and in the liver. Pasteurized Akk (Akk-past) was  more efficient than live Akk in elevating the intestinal concentrations  of polyamines, short-chain fatty acids, 2-hydroxybutyrate, as well  multiple bile acids, which also increased in the circulation.

People of all kinds are already able to get life-saving procedures such as surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc.

&gt; 
&gt; Importance  
&gt; 
&gt; Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in older adults, appears to have no effective preventive measures. The common antidiabetic drug metformin has been shown to have protective outcomes in multiple age-associated diseases and may have the potential to protect against the development of AMD.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Objective  
&gt; To determine whether metformin use is associated with reduced odds of developing AMD.
&gt; 
&gt; Design, Setting, and Participants  
&gt; 
&gt; This case-control study of patients from a nationwide health insurance claims database included a population-based sample of patients. Those aged 55 years and older with newly diagnosed AMD from January 2008 to December 2017 were defined as cases and matched with control participants. Data analyses were completed from June 2019 to February 2020.
&gt; 
&gt; Exposures  
&gt; Dosage of metformin and exposure to other prescribed medications, as identified from outpatient drug claims.
&gt; 
&gt;  Main Outcomes and Measures  
&gt; Risk of developing AMD.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt;  Results  
&gt; 
&gt; A total of 312 404 affected individuals were included (181 817 women [58.2%]). After matching, 312 376 control participants were included (172 459 women [55.2%]; age range, 55 to 107 years). The case group had a slightly higher percentage of participants with diabetes (81 262 participants [26.0%]) compared with the control group (79 497 participants [25.5%]). Metformin use was associated with reduced odds of developing AMD (odds ratio [OR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.92-0.96]). This association was dose dependent, with low to moderate doses of metformin showing the greatest potential benefit (dosages over 2 years: 1-270 g, OR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.94]; 271-600 g, OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.87-0.93]; 601-1080 g, OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.98]). Doses of more than 1080 g of metformin over 2 years did not have reduced odds of developing AMD. Both the reduction in odds ratio and the dose-dependent response were preserved in a cohort consisting only of patients with diabetes. Metformin use was associated with a decreased OR of AMD in patients with diabetes without coexisting diabetic retinopathy (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95]) but was a risk factor in patients with diabetic retinopathy (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.15]).
&gt;  
&gt; Conclusion and Relevance  
&gt; 
&gt; In this study, metformin use was associated with reduced odds of developing AMD. This association was dose dependent, with the greatest benefit at low to moderate doses. When looking only at patients with diabetes, we saw a preservation of the dose-dependent decrease in the odds of patients developing AMD. Metformin does not appear to be protective in patients with diabetes and coexisting diabetic retinopathy. This study suggests that metformin may be useful as a preventive therapy for AMD and provides the basis for potential prospective clinical trials.",7,1614078820,longevity

Moreover, Tom’s laboratory made significant and lasting discoveries demonstrating that the prevention and repair of somatic damage determines lifespan. Finally, Tom found a way to study the origins and consequences of stochastic components of aging, arguably uncovering the first robust biomarker and predictor of aging. Johnson’s contributions form the bedrock of an entire subfield in biology, and are also the foundation of the current revolution in biomedical research that is targeting the aging processes to prevent age-related chronic diseases, from Alzheimer’s to cancer.

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

*TAME: a genuinely good use of 75 million dollars*

“The problem with calorie restriction is that it confirms all the theories of aging” – Roy Walford (paraphrased)

In  the past month (or few months, depending when you’re reading this), the  news broke that the  celebrated  TAME  trial has  finally  accumulated  the  funding it  needs in  order to begin.  It is  thus timely  for  me  to  comment on  a  variety of  issues  around which  it has divided the  (broadly-defined) gerontology community. First a little background, for  the non-nerds among you. (Or, as the nerds would say it, for those  of   you  who  have  been  living  under  a  rock  for  the  past  few   years.  Perhaps  I sympathise  with  both  groups…)  The  TAME  trial   is  an  attempt  to  determine  whether metformin,  the  well-known   anti-diabetes  drug,  actually  has  much  more  wide-ranging benefits  against the health problems of late life – so wide-ranging, in fact,  that they could uncontroversially be described as addressing aging  itself.

First, why would we even  think that metformin might do this? If it did, wouldn’t we already know,  since it has been given to a massive number of people over the past  decades? Well, that’s actually a big reason why the trial has been  proposed: according to a recent study,1 metformin seems to extend  lifespan, which is the ultimate acid test of intervention against aging.   Specifically, it  has  been  reported that  diabetics taking   metformin  live  longer, on average, than non-diabetics: in other words,  that the overall benefit of metformin is  not just non-zero, it  actually outweighs the harm done by diabetes.

So  far so good. But then, hang on, metformin is an old drug. I mean, a  really old drug – it has been off patent since forever. There is no way  in hell to make money out of it. So, how would we fund a clinical trial  of it? Well, yes: the only way is philanthropic. This will only happen  if there are people out there who are sufficently convinced of the  importance of such a trial that they will pony up the requisite capital  even though doing so is completely bereft of financial upside.

A  tall order, right? But the logic is persuasive in another way:  precisely because metformin is such an old drug, a  trial can  immediately focus on efficacy, in contrast to the need for stringent  tests of safety to come first in the case of a new drug. And, sure  enough, pretty much as soon as the idea of such a trial was formulated,  nearly half of the required $75M was pledged  by the long-standing  supporter of  gerontology research, Paul Glenn, via  (as has  long  been  his  custom) the  American Federation  for  Aging Research  (AFAR). At   that point,  however,  the  pursuit  of  funds  stalled  for  a  couple   of  years  –  in  particular,  the National Institute on Aging twice  rejected applications for the remaining money – but, as noted above, the  remaining support materialised very recently, courtesy of an anonymous  donor. A question remains, however: is this, in fact, the best use of  $75M in the crusade against aging? Well, that’s a few times the total  amount that SENS Research Foundation has raised in its entire history,  so it will not surprise you that I cannot quite look you in the eye and  answer that  question in the affirmative. But  it is certainly not a   waste of money either: indeed, I do feel able to declare that it is a  pretty good use. Here’s why.

First,   I  think  there  is  a  reasonable  chance  that  the  trial  will   succeed,  albeit  modestly. There’s no way that a brief course of  metformin will give people a decade of extra life, but all that’s really  needed here is a statistically significant improvement versus controls,  and with that kind of money the study can be powered well enough to  achieve that threshold, even with a really small difference between the  means of the groups. And in terms of the impact  on  sentiment within   big pharma,  as regards  investing  in  the discovery  of future such  drugs, the value of proving the principle that aging can be modified in  humans – even a little bit – could be very great.

The  other rationale for this trial is arguably even greater. It is that the  description of the trial incorporates a de facto definitition of aging  as the clinical endpoint, which has been more-or-less  approved by  the  FDA,  and which  can  thus  be copied  and  pasted  into any future   trial for  an  intervention  against  aging.  That  endpoint was  the  result  of  a highly arduous negotiation with the FDA that was led by  the inestimable Nir Barzilai, who is also the  PI  of  the  trial.  The   challenge,  which  had  defeated  gerontologists  for  decades  previously,  was  to  find  a  formula  that  combined  two  goals:  it   had  to  be  one  that gerontologists could accept as  being  “aging   in  all  but  name,” and  it  also had to be  one which the  FDA  could  accept  as being  sufficiently  objectively measurable  to constitute  a  criterion  for  success  or  failure.  The  solution  is,  well,   messy…  but  it  works.  It  is  a combinatorial  definition  that   incorporates  a  plethora  of  components  that  are  each,  individually,  uncontroversial  by FDA  standards,  but that  also   encapsulates  the essential fact of the crosstalk between the multiple  processes that contribute to our late-life decline in function.

One  might argue that since this definition of the trial endpoint is already  a done deal, we don’t actually need to shell out the money to make the  trial actually occur. But that’s not really the case: realistically, the  only way that big pharma are really going to believe that aging  is   now  something  for  which  the  FDA  will  approve  a  treatment  is   if  they  follow through and actually do it once.

So  I  wish the TAME  trial the best  of luck.  Metformin is  definitely  not the  Holy  Grail, but there  is  a  pretty  good  chance  that  the   demonstration  of  its  broad  impact  on  late-life decline  in health   will  prove  to be  the  vehicle  that  gets  the  regulatory   authorities, and thence  the  medical  industry,  past the  conceptual   error  that  has  for  so  long  held  back commercial efforts to bring  aging under true medical control.

Not only are older persons the most vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality, but many of the mitigation efforts to slow the spread of the virus have imposed yet further emotional and mental health burdens on the most vulnerable among those over age 70. To help prevent future infectious disease mortality and suffering, as well as the profound health burdens from the chronic diseases associated with ageing, insights from biogerontology must become an integral part of global public health priorities.

&gt;The goal of geroscience  
&gt;  
&gt;**The goal of geroscience is extension of lifespan by extending healthspan.** Standard medical interventions can prolong lifespan without extending healthspan (e.g., using a ventilator in comatose patient) but anti-aging interventions increase lifespan by slowing aging and thus delaying age-related diseases (extending healthspan). One of the notions of hyperfunction theory is that age-related diseases can be prevented and treated by slowing down aging with anti-aging drugs, such as rapamycin, as discussed in 2006–2012 \[[2](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R2), [20](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R20)–[22](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R22)\] and later named the geroscience hypothesis \[[23](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R23)–[26](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R26)\].  
&gt;  
&gt;Lifespan vs healthspan  
&gt;  
&gt;Healthspan is a period of life without age-related diseases \[[27](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R27)\]. It is disease-free survival. **Since animals and humans die from age-related diseases, an increase in healthspan is expected to increase lifespan**. For example, in centenarians, healthspan is increased (this is why they are centenarians) \[[28](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R28)\]. Calorie restriction (CR) delays diseases and thus extends lifespan in rodents \[[29](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R29)\]. So healthspan is a surrogate for lifespan.  
&gt;  
&gt; So w**hy has healthspan become so popular in animal studies?** The reason is that **only a few drugs were shown to extend lifespan in mammals**. Other drugs seemingly increase healthspan but do not extend lifespan. This is considered an acceptable and even desirable effect \[[27](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#R27)\]. **But it is not. Increased healthspan must automatically increase lifespan** ([Figure 1A](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#F1) and [1B](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27882/text/#F1)), **if healthspan represents good health**.

&gt; 
&gt; Using samples from the New England Centenarian Study (NECS), we sought to characterize the serum proteome of 77 centenarians, 82 centenarians' offspring, and 65 age‐matched controls of the offspring (mean ages: 105, 80, and 79 years). We identified 1312 proteins that significantly differ between centenarians and their offspring and controls (FDR &lt; 1%), and two different protein signatures that predict longer survival in centenarians and in younger people. By comparing the centenarian signature with 2 independent proteomic studies of aging, we replicated the association of 484 proteins of aging and we identified two serum protein signatures that are specific of extreme old age. The data suggest that centenarians acquire similar aging signatures as seen in younger cohorts that have short survival periods, suggesting that they do not escape normal aging markers, but rather acquire them much later than usual. For example, centenarian signatures are significantly enriched for senescence‐associated secretory phenotypes, consistent with those seen with younger aged individuals, and from this finding, we provide a new list of serum proteins that can be used to measure cellular senescence. Protein co‐expression network analysis suggests that a small number of biological drivers may regulate aging and extreme longevity, and that changes in gene regulation may be important to reach extreme old age. This centenarian study thus provides additional signatures that can be used to measure aging and provides specific circulating biomarkers of healthy aging and longevity, suggesting potential mechanisms that could help prolong health and support longevity.

&gt; People who have genetically elevated free bilirubin levels, a clinically benign autosomal recessive disorder called Gilbert’s syndrome,[22][23] display lower rates of death from any cause (-50%) compared to the general population,[24] as well as lower levels of oxidative stress[25] and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[26][27] 

&gt; In animals, using drugs to increase production of free bilirubin, termed “Iatrogenic Gilbert syndrome'',[28] and administering free bilirubin directly have demonstrated benefits towards obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type-2 diabetes.[29] Several drugs have also been explored for health benefits through directly inhibiting NADPH oxidase.[30] 

&gt; Spirulina’s health effects are believed to be owed primarily to its phycocyanobilin content, which is structurally similar to bilirubin and, like bilirubin, acts to inhibit NADPH oxidase. The inhibition of NADPH oxidase reduces oxidative stress and may be an underlying factor in the health benefits associated with Gilbert’s syndrome, a condition characterized by high levels of free bilirubin.

It is not really well explored beyond this.   Someone self-experimenting might be able to try multiple measures of biological aging using the new biological clocks after cycling off (to avoid temporary perturbation), because telomere length is not a good indicator.

Resistance manifests itself in many forms, ranging from concerns such as overpopulation to concerns about unequal access to life-extending treatments.

However, the most unexpected thing is probably that people often don’t want an increased lifespan at all. Surveys in different countries show that when people are asked “how long would you like to live?”, they often give a number equal to or slightly higher than the current life expectancy in a given country [1-4].

Wait, isn’t extending life by decades something that everyone should strive for? Why do we often see a lack of enthusiasm for the idea in general?

,chromosomalcrossover,"Press release: [Japanese scientists discover medical agent that could slow aging-related diseases](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/01/16/national/science-health/slowly-aging-agent/)

&gt; A Japanese research team has discovered a medical agent capable of only removing senescent cells, which can cause aging-related diseases such as arteriosclerosis and diabetes.  

&gt; The team, including researchers from the University of Tokyo, Niigata University and Kyushu University, succeeded in improving symptoms of such diseases in mice through the use of the medical agent.  

&gt; The discovery is expected to help improve the treatment and prevention of such age-associated diseases.  

&gt; A paper about the finding was published in the U.S. journal Science on Friday.  

&gt; When cells come under stress they transform into senescent cells and accumulate in the body with aging.  

&gt; Previous research with elderly mice has shown that it is possible to delay the development of arteriosclerosis and kidney disorder by removing senescent cells from the body using a special method.  

&gt; But the use of a medical agent in the removal of such cells had not been discovered until now.  

&gt; Makoto Nakanishi, a professor at the University of Tokyo’s Institute of Medical Science, and other team members looked for the gene necessary for a senescent cell to survive and identified glutaminase 1, or GLS1, a gene related to glutamine metabolism.  

&gt; The team also found that the inside of a senescent cell is acidified due to an abnormality in cell organelles, and GLS1 actively works to neutralize inside of the cell and keep it alive.  

&gt; When administered with an inhibitor of GLS1, senescent cells in a variety of organs in elderly mice were eliminated and improvements in kidney, lung and liver functions were confirmed.  

&gt; Improvements were also seen in mice with arteriosclerosis or diabetes.  

&gt; The inhibitor is expected to have similar effects on the human body, as it has been learned that GLS1 in the human body also becomes more active with aging.  

&gt; The inhibitor of GLS1 has already been used in clinical trials as a candidate for cancer treatment.  

&gt; “It may also be effective for treating other age-associated diseases such as dementia,” Nakanishi said. “It would be great if we could try to carry out clinical trials (for such use) in the next five to 10 years.”

&gt;The aging proteostasis decline manifests in a failure of aging cells and organisms to properly respond to proteotoxic challenges. This proteostasis collapse has long been considered a hallmark of aging in nematodes, and has recently been shown to occur also in human cells upon entry to senescence, opening the way to exploring the phenomenon in the broader context of human aging. Cellular senescence is part of the normal human physiology of aging, with senescent cell accumulation as a prominent feature of aged tissues. Being highly resistant to cell death, senescent cells, as they accumulate, become pro-inflammatory and promote disease. Here we discuss the causes of human senescence proteostasis decline, in view of the current literature on nematodes, on the one hand, and senescence, on the other hand. We review two major aspects of the phenomenon: (1) the decline in transcriptional activation of stress-response pathways, and (2) impairments in proteasome function. We further outline potential underlying mechanisms of transcriptional proteostasis decline, focusing on reduced chromatin dynamics and compromised nuclear integrity. Finally, we discuss potential strategies for reinforcing proteostasis as a means to improve organismal health and address the relationship to senolytics.",2,1610866836,longevity

,basmwklz,"Abstract:
&gt;Cellular senescence contributes to age-related disorders including physical dysfunction, disabilities and mortality caused by tissue inflammation and damage. Senescent cells accumulate in multiple tissues with aging and at etiological sites of multiple chronic disorders. The senolytic drug combination, Dasatinib plus Quercetin (D+Q), is known to reduce senescent cell abundance in aged mice. However, the effects of long-term D+Q treatment on intestinal senescent cell and inflammatory burden and microbiome composition in aged mice remain unknown. Here, we examine the effect of D+Q on senescence (p16 Ink4a and p21 Cip1) and inflammation (Cxcl1, Il1β, Il6, Mcp1, and Tnfα) markers in small (ileum) and large (caecum and colon) intestine in aged mice (n=10) compared to age-matched placebo-treated mice (n=10). Additionally, we examine microbial composition along the intestinal tract in these mice. D+Q-treated mice show significantly lower senescent cell (p16 and p21 expression) and inflammatory (Cxcl1, Il1β, Il6, Mcp1 and Tnfα expression) burden in small and large intestine compared with control mice. Further, we find specific microbial signatures in ileal, cecal, colonic and fecal regions that are distinctly modulated by D+Q, with modulation being most prominent in small intestine. Further analyses reveal specific correlation of senescence and inflammation markers with specific microbial signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that the senolytic treatment reduces intestinal senescence and inflammation while altering specific microbiota signatures and suggest that the optimized senolytic regimens might improve health via reducing intestinal senescence, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in older subjects.",3,1610255848,longevity
,Roberto_Avelar,"I would say a cell has to evade both senescence and apoptosis to become tumorigenic. It is ideal for most senescent cells to be apoptosed, and from my understanding part of the reason senescent cells are detrimental is because the body can't seem to readily destroy them as we age (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13270#.X6mHn550Nwo.twitter which I linked previously talks about this theory quite nicely). 

I will say that genes driving the senescence process are quite well-preserved evolutionarily, more-so than other genes (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-01990-9 also linked above - supplementary figure one of our papers shows this https://github.com/maglab/CellAge_supplementary/blob/master/Additional%20File%202.pdf). This implies that there is definitely benefit in having these genes (many of these genes are cell cycle regulators as well). One theory from the first paper I linked is that the body simply isn't very good at detecting senescent cells and doesn't want to risk apoptosing healthy cells, so this is a reason why they could be accumulating with age. You are right that senescent cells can cause inflammation and the SASP actually induces senescence in other nearby cells. It's likely that senescence is an example of antagonistic pleiotropy, where early in life it helps to evade cancer, but later in life just causes damage.

There are some studies showing that there are population of cells in the body that seem to be senescent and necessary for health, at least in mice (liver here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32485135/ lung here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.142893v1 note the second paper is a preprint and a few people i know were not fans of the first paper's conclusions). It's not clear to me if these cells are simply all senescent by nature due to their location, or if being senescent is necessary for their important functions.

Senescent cells are quite resistant to apoptosis, but cancer cells are too. It's important to keep that in mind. Senescence might exist as a 'back-up' mechanism when cells become resistant to apoptosis to prevent cancer. Many treatments like chemotherapy are designed to try to induce stress in transformed cells that triggers the senescence process before eliminating them by other means. This is also partially why chemo won't work for all cancers - if the cells have mutations that allow them to overcome senescence, chemo might not work.",2,1610105824,longevity

&gt; Background

&gt; Mounting evidence supports the occurrence of accelerating aging among long-term survivors of childhood cancer. We aimed to investigate epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in survivors and evaluate associations between EAA, treatment exposures, health behaviors, and chronic health conditions (CHCs).
&gt; 

&gt; Methods

&gt; Genome-wide methylation data were generated with Infinium EPIC BeadChip on blood-derived DNA from 2139 survivors and 282 frequency matched controls from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study. EAAs were estimated as residuals from a linear regression of epigenetic age (Levine’s clock) against chronological age. Adjusted least square mean (ALSM) of EAA was calculated and compared between survivors and controls, across treatment exposures and health behaviors. Associations of EAA with 20 clinically assessed CHCs were evaluated with multivariable piecewise-exponential models. All statistical tests for P values below were 2-sided.
&gt; 

&gt; Results

&gt; EAA was statistically significantly higher in survivors than controls (ALSM = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26 to 1.01 vs −3.61, 95% CI = −4.43 to 2.80). In a multivariable model among survivors, statistically significantly higher EAA (P &lt; .05) was observed in those exposed to chest radiotherapy, abdomen or pelvic radiotherapy, alkylating agents, glucocorticoids, or epipodophyllotoxins. Compared with survivors with favorable health behaviors (ALSM = 0.26, 95% CI=−0.36 to 0.87), EAA was statistically significantly higher among survivors with intermediate (ALSM = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.54) or unfavorable health behaviors (ALSM = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.60 to 2.30). In time-to-event analyses, statistically significant associations were identified between EAA tertiles and incidence of 7 CHCs: hypertension (3rd vs 1st tertile, relative rate [RR] = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.83), myocardial infarction (RR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.27 to 7.21), obesity (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.66), obstructive pulmonary deficit (RR = 1.86, 95% CI = 0.95 to 3.77), peripheral motor neuropathy (RR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.24 to 6.97), peripheral sensory neuropathy (RR = 2.04, 95% CI = 0.99 to 4.26), and pulmonary diffusion deficits (RR = 2.75, 95% CI = 0.95 to 7.63).
&gt; 
&gt; Conclusions

&gt; EAA is statistically significantly higher in survivors of childhood cancer than in noncancer controls and is associated with specific treatment exposures, unfavorable health behaviors, and presence of specific CHCs.",1,1609929056,longevity

&gt; White fat stores excess energy, whereas brown and beige fat are thermogenic and dissipate energy as heat. Thermogenic adipose tissues markedly improve glucose and lipid homeostasis in mouse models, although the extent to which brown adipose tissue (BAT) influences metabolic and cardiovascular disease in humans is unclear1,2. Here we retrospectively categorized 134,529 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography scans from 52,487 patients, by presence or absence of BAT, and used propensity score matching to assemble a study cohort. Scans in the study population were initially conducted for indications related to cancer diagnosis, treatment or surveillance, without previous stimulation. We report that individuals with BAT had lower prevalences of cardiometabolic diseases, and the presence of BAT was independently correlated with lower odds of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension. These findings were supported by improved blood glucose, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein values. The beneficial effects of BAT were more pronounced in individuals with overweight or obesity, indicating that BAT might play a role in mitigating the deleterious effects of obesity. Taken together, our findings highlight a potential role for BAT in promoting cardiometabolic health.

""Various Leisure-Time Physical Activities Associated With Widely Divergent Life Expectancies: The Copenhagen City Heart Study


Objective
To evaluate the differential improvements in life expectancy associated with participation in various sports.


Patients and Methods
The Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) is a prospective population study that included detailed questionnaires regarding participation in different types of sports and leisure-time physical activity. The 8577 participants were followed for up to 25 years for all-cause mortality from their examination between October 10, 1991, and September 16, 1994, until March 22, 2017. Relative risks were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with full adjustment for confounding variables.


Results
Multivariable-adjusted life expectancy gains compared with the sedentary group for different sports were as follows: tennis, 9.7 years; badminton, 6.2 years; soccer, 4.7 years; cycling, 3.7 years; swimming, 3.4 years; jogging, 3.2 years; calisthenics, 3.1 years; and health club activities, 1.5 years.""",1,1609854701,longevity

&gt; Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest triggered by various stressors, engages in a category of pathological processes, whereby senescent cells accumulate in mitotic tissues. Senolytics as novel medicine against aging and various diseases through the elimination of senescent cells has emerged rapidly in recent years. Exercise is a potent anti‐aging and anti‐chronic disease medicine, which has shown the capacity to lower the markers of cellular senescence over the past decade. However, whether exercise is a senolytic medicine for aging and various diseases remains unclear. Here, we have conducted a systematic review of the published literature studying the senolytic effects of exercise or physical activity on senescent cells under various states in both human and animal models. Exercise can reduce the markers of senescent cells in healthy humans, while it lowered the markers of senescent cells in obese but not healthy animals. The discrepancy between human and animal studies may be due to the relatively small volume of research and the variations in markers of senescent cells, types of cells/tissues, and health conditions. These findings suggest that exercise has senolytic properties under certain conditions, which warrant further investigations.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; According to the World Health Organization, the population of over 60 will double in the next 30 years in the developed countries, which will enforce a further raise of the retirement age and increase the burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, there is an acute issue of maintaining health and prolonging active working longevity, as well as implementation of early monitoring and prevention of premature aging and age-related disorders to avoid early disability. Traditional indicators of biological age are not always informative and often require extensive and expensive analysis. 

&gt; The study of blood factors is a simple and easily accessible way to assess individual health and supplement the traditional indicators of a person’s biological age with new objective criteria. With age, the processes of growth and development, tissue regeneration and repair decline; they are gradually replaced by enhanced catabolism, inflammatory cell activity, and insulin resistance. The number of senescent cells supporting the inflammatory loop rises; cellular clearance by autophagy and mitophagy slows down, resulting in mitochondrial and cellular damage and dysfunction. Monitoring of circulated blood factors not only reflects these processes, but also allows suggesting medical intervention to prevent or decelerate the development of age-related diseases. 

&gt; We review the age-related blood factors discussed in recent publications, as well as approaches to slowing aging for healthy and active longevity.

At the scale of human decision-making, the real question is whether rejuvenation is a fundamentally intrusive process, or not? Since our biology already knows how to rejuvenate non-intrusively, I think it is a mistake to assume that the solution to aging and death must be intrusive.

Whether non-intrusive solutions are genetic, epigenetic or something else is, to me, just an implementation detail. I trust the biologists to figure that all out. But I don't trust Western medicine to opt for a non-intrusive solution when a more costly, intrusive solution is available that will jack up health insurance premiums and increase demand for prescription drugs.",1,1609122748,longevity

""Back in 2005, Drs. [Irina](https://www.lifespan.io/profile/irina-conboy/) and Michael Conboy created a furor with their research on parabiosis, which links two vascular systems together. The Conboys connected the vascular systems of young and old mice and showed that as a result of the blood exchange, old mice became younger and vice versa \[1\]. This discovery spurred a flurry of research activity; for instance, earlier this year,[ we reported on some highly promising results](https://www.lifespan.io/news/blood-factors-reverse-epigenetic-age-by-half-in-rats/) of adding a cocktail of young blood factors to the bloodstreams of aging mice. However, the Conboys have always maintained that it is what we take out of the bloodstream that matters more. A few months ago, they showed that mere dilution of blood plasma with saline can produce a considerable rejuvenating effect (read[ our June interview with them](https://www.lifespan.io/news/diluting-blood-plasma-rejuvenates-old-mice/)). Later, in November, [they published another paper](https://www.lifespan.io/news/diluting-aged-blood-rejuvenates-old-brains/) that demonstrated restoration of cognitive functions following plasma dilution.

However, all this research has been done on mice, which led a small group of Russian biohackers to take matters in their own hands. Biohacking is a form of citizen science: do-it-yourself biology experiments. For biohackers focused on longevity, this includes performing experimental treatments (often on themselves) or repurposing existing treatments to improve health and, hopefully, wind back biological age.""

,ptword,"You're right, the papers don't necessarily support that high intensity is harmful. Not conclusive in that regard, but I still say that an excess of exercise can be more detrimental than good... like anything in life.

Many top athletes work under the supervision of a dedicated physician team and (in modern times) a nutritionist so it's not clear whether or not they're taking things beyond what the body is capable of without jeopardizing longevity. Athletes who had to bulk up or somehow adapt their bodies in an unatural way to do what they do probably have a less clear longevity advantage over the genral population.

When I think of an ""excess"" of physical exercise, I don't mean just the intensity or frequency of it, but also how it shapes the body. I tend to think of some power sports, sedentary people who hit the gym often in an attempt to look ""big"" or have a big butt, or those who are practically addicted to exercise and just want to *gorillafy* their ego, eat tons of food (especially protein) every day, have skyrocketing metabolisms, etc... Some of these folks then attract a horde of followers who want to be just like them. Some become ""personal trainers"" and pass on longevity-jeopardizing habits to others.

It's mostly an issue of people not understanding the repercussions of what they're doing to their bodies. The workout itself may not even be necessarily very high intensity, but the changes that it imparts on the body over time can be detrimental to longevity. All these weird fitness trends today may help them look ""bigger"" or ""thicc"" now, but all that added muscle will be increasingly difficult to maintain as they age. Too much mass, too much metabolism, too much dna damage, too much inflammation, too much senescent cells, too much many factors precipitating the aging process.

Not saying this is all people who go to the gym, of course. But it's a notable trend in gym/fitness culture in Western culture nowadays. People who exercise for health or maintenance in a way that is natural for their bodies are fine.",1,1608649686,longevity
,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; Aging in humans is an incredibly complex biological process that leads to increased susceptibility to various diseases. 

&gt; Understanding which genes are associated with healthy aging can provide valuable insights into aging mechanisms and possible avenues for therapeutics to prolong healthy life. 

&gt; However, modeling this complex biological process requires an enormous collection of high‐quality data along with cutting‐edge computational methods. Here, we have compiled a large meta‐analysis of gene expression data from RNA‐Seq experiments available from the Sequence Read Archive. 

&gt; We began by reprocessing more than 6000 raw samples—including mapping, filtering, normalization, and batch correction—to generate 3060 high‐quality samples spanning a large age range and multiple different tissues. We then used standard differential expression analyses and machine learning approaches to model and predict aging across the dataset, achieving an R2 value of 0.96 and a root‐mean‐square error of 3.22 years. These models allow us to explore aging across health status, sex, and tissue and provide novel insights into possible aging processes. We also explore how preprocessing parameters affect predictions and highlight the reproducibility limits of these machine learning models. 

&gt; Finally, we develop an online tool for predicting the ages of human transcriptomic samples given raw gene expression counts.

So where does your linked PDF come from?

In 2006, there was a competition organised where people had to come up with objections to SENS to convince a panel that it was not a worthwhile endeavour.

Website with details: http://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/

As you can see, AdG responded: http://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal_rebuttal.pdf


No one who submitted objections was able to convince the panel that SENS was not a worthwhile endeavour, so you are actually posting a losing entry.

Aubrey commented on the competition, in an interview here if you're interested:

https://80000hours.org/2012/04/living-to-1000-an-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/

&gt; ZR: You’ve drawn some aggressive criticism for the methods you propose for curing aging. The most direct engagement I found with the science was the MIT Technology Review’s Life Extension Pseudoscience and the SENS Plan. Have you written anything extensive in response to these (or comments like them) that we can read online?

&gt; AdG: Yes, of course I have! The piece was not written by MIT TR, but by a few gerontologists in submission to a prize competition that they organised with my cooperation, and the rules were that I would write a rebuttal of each submission and the two would be evaluated by a panel of five neutral experts (which included Craig Venter). Naturally, no entry (including this one) succeeded in persuading the panel. 


So it is kinda meaningless at this point, given what's happened between 2006 and 2020.   Like, people recognising the hallmarks of aging, and people working on damage repair/clearance approaches etc.

In addition to not convincing the expert panel, people have moved on, as we are seeing health gains and reversal of deficits with the SENS approach in animal models.   Human trials are underway.

There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

CSF Aβ40 and plasma Aβ40 levels declined more in the placebo group than the resveratrol-treated group, resulting in a significant difference at week 52. Brain volume loss was increased by resveratrol treatment compared to placebo.

These findings persisted when participants with weight loss were excluded. The interpretation of greater brain volume loss with resveratrol treatment is unclear, but this finding was not associated with greater cognitive or functional decline. In fact, less decline (a clinical benefit) with treatment was detected in a functional measure—the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL).

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:


&gt; 
Human DNA methylation data have been used to develop biomarkers of ageing, referred to as ‘epigenetic clocks’, which have been widely used to identify differences between chronological age and biological age in health and disease including neurodegeneration, dementia and other brain phenotypes. 

&gt; Existing DNA methylation clocks have been shown to be highly accurate in blood but are less precise when used in older samples or in tissue types not included in training the model, including brain. We aimed to develop a novel epigenetic clock that performs optimally in human cortex tissue and has the potential to identify phenotypes associated with biological ageing in the brain. 

&gt; We generated an extensive dataset of human cortex DNA methylation data spanning the life course (n = 1397, ages = 1 to 108 years). This dataset was split into ‘training’ and ‘testing’ samples (training: n = 1047; testing: n = 350). DNA methylation age estimators were derived using a transformed version of chronological age on DNA methylation at specific sites using elastic net regression, a supervised machine learning method. The cortical clock was subsequently validated in a novel independent human cortex dataset (n = 1221, ages = 41 to 104 years) and tested for specificity in a large whole blood dataset (n = 1175, ages = 28 to 98 years). We identified a set of 347 DNA methylation sites that, in combination, optimally predict age in the human cortex. The sum of DNA methylation levels at these sites weighted by their regression coefficients provide the cortical DNA methylation clock age estimate. The novel clock dramatically outperformed previously reported clocks in additional cortical datasets.  

&gt; Our findings suggest that previous associations between predicted DNA methylation age and neurodegenerative phenotypes might represent false positives resulting from clocks not robustly calibrated to the tissue being tested and for phenotypes that become manifest in older ages. The age distribution and tissue type of samples included in training datasets need to be considered when building and applying epigenetic clock algorithms to human epidemiological or disease cohorts.",1,1607591403,longevity

&gt;Numerous aspects of lipid metabolism have been implicated in the genesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given the prevalence and mortality of CVD, it is essential to identify optimal biomarkers of lipid metabolism that may provide better risk prediction. Several lipid biomarkers have been proposed for monitoring, and several methods have been developed for measuring them. This Practical Guide aims to identify those markers, evaluate their relevance to CVD risk prediction, and determine the best lipid monitoring protocol available at the moment.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Methods  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A list of potential lipid parameters was compiled from medical and laboratory resources. A literature search was then conducted on PubMed for each parameter. Additionally, we reviewed the major clinical practice guidelines on lipid monitoring.   
Our search identified 21 lipid biomarkers ranging from those included in a standard lipid panel to those that are just entering clinical practice. For each biomarker, the main evidence for and against its use in CVD risk prediction was summarized. The available information on test types, standardization &amp; error, reference values, factors affecting measurement, and frequency of testing for each parameter was analyzed.

doi (for sci-hub): 10.1073/pnas.2011243117

&amp;nbsp;

Abstract:

&gt; DICER is a key enzyme in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Here we show that aerobic exercise training up-regulates DICER in adipose tissue of mice and humans. This can be mimicked by infusion of serum from exercised mice into sedentary mice and depends on AMPK-mediated signaling in both muscle and adipocytes. Adipocyte DICER is required for whole-body metabolic adaptations to aerobic exercise training, in part, by allowing controlled substrate utilization in adipose tissue, which, in turn, supports skeletal muscle function. Exercise training increases overall miRNA expression in adipose tissue, and up-regulation of miR-203-3p limits glycolysis in adipose under conditions of metabolic stress. We propose that exercise training-induced DICER-miR-203-3p up-regulation in adipocytes is a key adaptive response that coordinates signals from working muscle to promote whole-body metabolic adaptations.

Significance:

&gt; Aerobic exercise elicits an integrated metabolic response that involves multiple tissues and confers beneficial effects to metabolic health. Here we found that this integrative response involves energy-sensing pathways in muscle and fat and circulating factors that lead to the upregulation of the type III endoribonuclease DICER in adipose tissue and the consequent increase of microRNAs. Upon upregulation, DICER and the microRNA-203-3p inhibit glucose utilization by fat cells and favor oxidative metabolism. In turn, this supports the exercised muscle with adequate substrate availability. When this pathway is disrupted, whole-body metabolism is affected, and exercise performance is impaired. Thus, adipose tissue DICER integrates signals from the exercising muscle to allow a proper metabolic response to exercise training.",1,1607423464,longevity

But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal. That means that we still do not fully understand telomeres or their role in aging and disease. So trying to lengthen or shorten your telomeres as a health intervention is arguably premature and, at worst, harmful, some experts say.


Just beyond that, I am not saying telomere attrition is not a concern, it certainly is as an established hallmark of aging... but things that simply increase telomere length in one type of circulating blood cell do not tell us much at all.


Some recent research about length: [Salk scientists find that for stem cells to be healthy, telomere length has to be just right (2016)](http://www.salk.edu/news-release/goldilocks-effect-aging-research/)

These weaknesses of telomere measurements lacking predictive properties is the reason that aging clocks have been sought after, like the Horvath clock, Grimage, Levine etc.

[Wikipedia article on the Epigenetic clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic_clock)  

These clocks are still experimental, but they are providing insights from blood samples that appear to reflect aging across the whole organism, something which telomere measurement does not share (length can be different in different organs, and I recall hearing about some recent research that it can even vary from week to week, so single measurements might not be large enough sample sizes (if you can even put aside that you can't measure telomere length in multiple tissues in subjects easily as a researcher or consumer).

These billionaires are aware of the industry and placed some businesses bets on it. You know why they aren’t worrying?

They are focusing in other industries that have the highest profits in the short term first, eg. 6g (China already sent experimental 6g satellite), AI, VR, AR, and space travels (the profits from millitary is HUGE).

&gt; **Research on astronaut health and model organisms have revealed six features of spaceflight biology that guide our current understanding of fundamental molecular changes that occur during space travel. The features include oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, epigenetic changes (including gene regulation), telomere length alterations, and microbiome shifts. Here we review the known hazards of human spaceflight, how spaceflight affects living systems through these six fundamental features, and the associated health risks of space exploration. We also discuss the essential issues related to the health and safety of astronauts involved in future missions, especially planned long-duration and Martian missions.**

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; Understanding factors contributing to variation in ‘biological age’ is essential to understanding variation in susceptibility to disease and functional decline. One factor that could accelerate biological aging in women is reproduction. Pregnancy is characterized by extensive, energetically-costly changes across numerous physiological systems. These ‘costs of reproduction’ may accumulate with each pregnancy, accelerating biological aging.  

&gt; Despite evidence for costs of reproduction using molecular and demographic measures, it is unknown whether parity is linked to commonly-used clinical measures of biological aging. We use data collected between 1999 and 2010 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 4418) to test whether **parity (number of live births)** predicted four previously-validated composite measures of biological age and system integrity: Levine Method, homeostatic dysregulation, Klemera–Doubal method biological age, and allostatic load. Parity exhibited a U-shaped relationship with accelerated biological aging when controlling for chronological age, lifestyle, health-related, and demographic factors in post-menopausal, but not pre-menopausal, women, with biological age acceleration being lowest among post-menopausal women reporting between three and four live births.  

&gt; Our findings suggest a link between reproductive function and physiological dysregulation, and allude to possible compensatory mechanisms that buffer the effects of reproductive function on physiological dysregulation during a woman’s reproductive lifespan. Future work should continue to investigate links between parity, menopausal status, and biological age using targeted physiological measures and longitudinal studies.",1,1606644081,longevity

,StoicOptom,"&gt; Background


&gt; Frailty, a state of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, is important in diabetes management. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of frailty in people with diabetes, and to summarise the association between frailty and generic outcomes (eg, mortality) and diabetes-specific outcomes (eg, hypoglycaemia).

&gt; Methods


&gt; In this systematic review and study-level meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science for observational studies published between Jan 1, 2001 (the year of the original publication of the Fried frailty phenotype), to Nov 26, 2019. We included studies that assessed and quantified frailty in adults with diabetes, aged 18 years and older; and excluded conference abstracts, grey literature, and studies not published in English. Data from eligible studies were extracted using a piloted data extraction form. Our primary outcome was the prevalence of frailty in people with diabetes. Secondary outcomes were incidence of frailty and generic and diabetes-specific outcomes. Data were assessed by random-effects meta-analysis where possible and by narrative synthesis where populations were too heterogeneous to allow meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020163109.

&gt; Findings

&gt; Of the 3038 studies we identified, 118 studies using 20 different frailty measures were eligible for inclusion (n=1 375 373). The most commonly used measures of frailty were the frailty phenotype (69 [58%] of 118 studies), frailty (16 [14%]), and FRAIL scale (10 [8%]). Studies were heterogenous in setting (88 studies were community-based, 18 were outpatient-based, ten were inpatient-based, and two were based in residential care facilities), demographics, and inclusion criteria; therefore, we could not do a meta-analysis for the primary outcome and instead summarised prevalence data using a narrative synthesis. Median community frailty prevalence using frailty phenotype was 13% (IQR 9–21). Frailty was consistently associated with mortality in 13 (93%) of 14 studies assessing this outcome (pooled hazard ratio 1·51 [95% CI 1·30–1·76]), with hospital admission in seven (100%) of seven, and with disability in five (100%) of five studies. Frailty was associated with hypoglycaemia events in one study (&lt;1%), microvascular and macrovascular complications in nine (82%) of 11 studies assessing complications, lower quality of life in three (100%) of three studies assessing quality of life, and cognitive impairment in three (100%) of three studies assessing cognitive impairment. 13 (11%) of 118 studies assessed glycated haemoglobin finding no consistent relationship with frailty.

&gt; Interpretation

&gt; **The identification and assessment of frailty should become a routine aspect of diabetes care. The relationship between frailty and glycaemia, and the effect of frailty in specific groups (eg, middle-aged [aged &lt;65 years] people and people in low-income and lower-middle-income countries) needs to be better understood to enable diabetes guidelines to be tailored to individuals with frailty.**",1,1605864690,longevity
,StoicOptom,"&gt; Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; The aging process is characterized by the presence of high interindividual variation between individuals of the same chronical age prompting a search for biomarkers that capture this heterogeneity. Epigenetic clocks measure changes in DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites that are highly correlated with calendar age. The discrepancy resulting from the regression of DNA methylation age on calendar age is hypothesised to represent a measure of biological ageing with a positive/negative residual signifying age acceleration /deceleration respectively. The present study examines the associations of four epigenetic clocks - Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge - with a wide range of clinical phenotypes (walking speed, grip strength, Fried frailty, polypharmacy, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Sustained Attention Reaction Time, 2-choice reaction time), and with all-cause mortality at up to 10-year follow-up, in a sample of 490 participants in the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Horvath Age Acceleration (AA) and HannumAA were not predictive of health; PhenoAgeAA was associated with 4/9 outcomes (walking speed, frailty MOCA, MMSE) in minimally adjusted models, but not when adjusted for other social and lifestyle factors. **GrimAgeAA by contrast was associated with 8/9 outcomes (all except grip strength) in minimally adjusted models, and remained a significant predictor of polypharmacy, frailty, and mortality in fully adjusted models. Results indicate that the GrimAge clock represents a step-improvement in the predictive utility of the epigenetic clocks for identifying age-related decline in an array of clinical phenotypes promising to advance precision medicine.**",1,1605864470,longevity

&gt; Impaired clearance in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brain is key in the formation of Aβ parenchymal plaques and cerebrovascular deposits known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), present in &gt;80% of AD patients and ~50% of non‐AD elderly subjects. 

&gt; Aβ deposits are highly heterogeneous, containing multiple fragments mostly derived from catabolism of Aβ40/Aβ42, which exhibit dissimilar aggregation properties. Remarkably, the role of these physiologically relevant Aβ species in cerebrovascular injury and their impact in vascular pathology is unknown. 

&gt; We sought to understand how heterogeneous Aβ species affect cerebral endothelial health and assess whether their diverse effects are associated with the peptides aggregation propensities. We analyzed cerebral microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) viability, blood‐brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and angiogenesis, all relevant aspects of brain microvascular dysfunction. 

&gt; We found that Aβ peptides and fragments exerted differential effects on cerebrovascular pathology. Peptides forming mostly oligomeric structures induced CMEC apoptosis, whereas fibrillar aggregates increased BBB permeability without apoptotic effects. Interestingly, all Aβ species tested inhibited angiogenesis in vitro. 

&gt; These data link the biological effects of the heterogeneous Aβ peptides to their primary structure and aggregation, strongly suggesting that the composition of amyloid deposits influences clinical aspects of the AD vascular pathology. As the presence of predominant oligomeric structures in proximity of the vessel walls may lead to CMEC death and induction of microhemorrhages, fibrillar amyloid is likely responsible for increased BBB permeability and associated neurovascular dysfunction.

,Idontknow1234568,"&gt;Abstract   
Our recent study has established that young blood factors are not causal, nor necessary, for the systemic rejuvenation of mammalian tissues. Instead, a procedure referred to as neutral blood exchange (NBE) that resets signaling milieu to a pro-regenerative state through dilution of old plasma, enhanced the health and repair of the muscle and liver, and promoted better hippocampal neurogenesis in 2-year-old mice (Mehdipour et al., *Aging* 12:8790–8819, 2020). Here we expand the rejuvenative phenotypes of NBE, focusing on the brain. Namely, our results demonstrate that old mice perform much better in novel object and novel texture (whisker discrimination) tests after a single NBE, which is accompanied by reduced neuroinflammation (less-activated CD68+ microglia). Evidence against attenuation/dilution of peripheral senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) as the main mechanism behind NBE was that the senolytic ABT 263 had limited effects on neuroinflammation and did not enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the old mice. Interestingly, peripherally acting ABT 263 and NBE both diminished SA-βGal signal in the old brain, demonstrating that peripheral senescence propagates to the brain, but NBE was more robustly rejuvenative than ABT 263, suggesting that rejuvenation was not simply by reducing senescence. Explaining the mechanism of the positive effects of NBE on the brain, our comparative proteomics analysis demonstrated that dilution of old blood plasma yields an increase in the determinants of brain maintenance and repair in mice and in people. These findings confirm the paradigm of rejuvenation through dilution of age-elevated systemic factors and extrapolate it to brain health and function.",1,1605558532,longevity

Other than that there are ongoing conversations about developing a universal set of markers (from blood tests and perhaps other factors) so there can be some uniformity in quantifying the effect of interventions on human aging.  

My conclusion is that this will be very hard to develop as my study of human metabolism has taught me that our various systems have incredible adaptability.

I  think of this as resilience and feel it is a result of our species having traveled to cover the globe. Most other species can only exist in relatively limited set of environmental conditions. Humans on the other hand have migrated from equatorial regions to much higher (or lower) latitudes in less time than it would take to evolve compensating factors. I feel this high degree of mobility and adaptability has led to very robust compensating capabilities in our metabolism.

This resilience, I feel, makes it difficult to accurately capture what single factor causes improvements in health and life span.

If providers have fewer resources to purchase and administer expensive new discoveries, there will be fewer resources for biotech companies to research and develop innovative therapies.

Having government-run hospitals has its own challenges as well. For example, in Canada physicians consider wait times to be longer than clinically reasonable for more than 80% of procedures. Additionally from my second source, *Canadians are sacrificing access to modern medical technology for first dollar coverage for primary care.* 

Note that I don't personally support keeping the US healthcare system as is. However, I don't support government-run insurance or government-run hospitals because I think there's a somewhat easier, better solution. I support a universal healthcare voucher system, as proposed by the Brookings Institute. Note that the voucher is not a specific dollar amount where some would fall short, but a voucher that guarantees enrollment in a qualified health plan, similar in requirements to qualifying health insurance plans for federal employees.

Abstract:

&gt; C60 is a potent antioxidant that has been reported to substantially extend the lifespan of rodents when formulated in olive oil (C60-OO) or extra virgin olive oil (C60-EVOO).

&gt;  Despite there being no regulated form of C60-OO, people have begun obtaining it from online sources and dosing it to themselves or their pets, presumably with the assumption of safety and efficacy. In this study, we obtain C60-OO from a sample of online vendors, and find marked discrepancies in appearance, impurity profile, concentration, and activity relative to pristine C60-OO formulated in-house. 

&gt; We additionally find that pristine C60-OO causes no acute toxicity in a rodent model but does form toxic species that can cause significant morbidity and mortality in mice in under 2 weeks when exposed to light levels consistent with ambient light. Intraperitoneal injections of C60-OO did not affect the lifespan of CB6F1 female mice. 

&gt; Finally, we conduct a lifespan and health span study in males and females C57BL/6 J mice comparing oral treatment with pristine C60-EVOO and EVOO alone versus untreated controls. **We failed to observe significant lifespan and health span benefits of C60-EVOO or EVOO supplementation compared to untreated controls, both starting the treatment in adult or old age.

,chromosomalcrossover,"&gt; When you say people continuously take this out of context, can you explain?

particularly the weinstein.pdf, if I were to generalise, this being the 6th or 7th time I've put it into context when someone has linked it saying ""Bret is against Aubrey"" or ""Bret is against curing aging""...  people link it without context of time or place, as if it's a timeless piece applicable in 2020.

I can't fault people for mistaking the PDF for being something else, as it contains no date and no additional information to say that it was a losing entry in a staged debate/competition.

I can't fault people for trying to defer to Bret in some form, he's a smart guy as an evolutionary biologist, and is outspoken against some forms of political BS that negatively affected his teaching career.  

&amp;nbsp;

That aside, I read the transcript of the video you linked, so will comment on that.  Bret is asked whether he would live forever, which is not what SENS is about, or the people advocating for theories of disease rooted in the biology of aging.

If you ask George Church, Aubrey De Grey, anyone working at SENS, the Buck Institute, even people working on lifespan studies of mice with interventions (the NIA's ITP) - none will say that their work is about living forever.   

It's about improving quality of life that gets completely wrecked by aging.   All the diseases that get worse with age, cancers, heart disease, susceptibility to infections, frailty, susceptibility to falls etc.   If we could wind aspects of aging back such that they don't trigger latent health conditions - wouldn't life be better?   It would inadvertently be longer too.   Being around longer and in good health is a good side effect.

Why do we do lifespan studies and gawk at interesting results that extend lifespan?  Theoretically it's cool, but we also care about preserving health, not just stretching the time until death if still sick/frail due to aging.

Even if you are not aged, if you have aging parents, or if you have older siblings, or if your parents have passed but you have a really old grantparent - their age takes a toll on young people who have to help them and look after them, instead of having more opportunity in life.

Having family members with age related disease can completely dominate your life, so why wouldn't we be in support of curing disease?  It's horrible to have to experience years of dementia etc.    

Death or immortality is like so far removed from the badness of aging that it's almost ridiculous to me that people retort based on death when asked about aging.

Some people even consider death positive in the light of our inability to do anything with serious cases of age related disease, you know preferring euthanasia to being just a shadow of their former selves.


So looking at the video:  

Bret takes the question ""would you live forever?"" as a psychological problem, saying people are just looking for alternatives to death.   Says that death gives life meaning... and you get to pass on ideas to your children.

Looking at it one, whoever asked this asked the wrong question.   

Why didn't they ask Bret ""hey, would you like to not get Alzheimer's disease?   or not get prostate cancer, and all the side effects that go with it for years?"" or ""would you give women an additional chance to have children in their 50s if they could be biologically younger, or are you against that?"",   ""are you for or against age related bladder weakness, do you think we should be able to hold it in like younger people or are you against that?""

Sorry, but living forever has little relevance to eradicating certain classes of disease and keeping people healthier for longer.

Anyway, I don't think the question did Bret justice.   He should sit down with Aubrey and do a podcast, so they can do some thoughtful exchange of ideas.",1,1604035581,longevity
,chromosomalcrossover,"&gt; This is an unprecedented crossroads in global society, raising fundamental questions about how we live as individuals, and collectively. Will an ageing population mean people experience longer periods of good health, a sustained sense of wellbeing, and extended periods of social engagement and productivity—or will it be associated with a higher burden of illness, disability, and dependence on others?

&gt; The science suggests that we have a choice.


&gt; It is against this complex backdrop that The Lancet Healthy Longevity is launched. This new open-access journal will address these issues head-on by publishing the best clinical research into ageing and age-related diseases (their aetiology, epidemiology, and treatment).

In the spirit of all Lancet titles, we will be active in advocacy to ensure that every life is treated with sanctity and respect, no matter how many years a person has lived. To that end we will also publish Comment, Health Policy and Review papers from across the basic, clinical, psychological, and social sciences that seek to challenge the status quo for the better.

,Idontknow1234568,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Researchers from Kumamoto University, Japan have proposed that cellular senescence variations during the aging process could lead to control of health and onset of age-related diseases. Based on the characteristics of the secretion of inflammatory cytokines released by aged cells, they hypothesize that there are at least four distinct states of cellular senescence, and that these four states arise from coordinated metabolic and epigenomic changes. Characterizing and categorizing qualitatively different states of cellular senescence could provide a new understanding of the aging and senescence process.  
&gt;  
&gt;The world's population is aging at an accelerated rate, especially in developed countries. Since the elderly population is expected to increase in the future, it especially important to maintain healthy life spans. Many of the cells that make up the body eventually decline in function and stop growing after repeated divisions in a process called ""cellular senescence,"" an important factor in health and longevity. Premature senescence occurs when genomic DNA is damaged by stressors such as radiation, ultraviolet light, or drugs, but its mechanisms are not yet fully understood. It can be good, like when cells become cancerous, cellular senescence works to prevent the development of malignancy, but it also increases the likelihood of many age-related diseases. It is therefore important for medical science to try to understand and control it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although senescent cells lose their ability to proliferate, recent research has shown that they secrete various proteins that act on surrounding cells and promote chronic inflammation and cancer cell growth. This is called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Cellular senescence is thought to be the cause of aging in the entire body. Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in the bodies of aged mice, and removal of these cells may suppress whole-body aging. In other words, if cellular senescence is controlled, it may become possible to regulate the aging process of the whole body.  
&gt;  
&gt;Professor Mitsuyoshi Nakao's research group at Kumamoto University is studying the mechanisms of cellular aging from the viewpoint of epigenetics--a research field that investigates the activities of the approximately 25,000 protein-coding genes on the human genome, related to life phenomena, health &amp; disease conditions, and aging in the human body. To date, the researchers have screened a wide range of factors involved in the aging of human fibroblasts (a cell type present in all tissues and organs) and found that SETD8 methyltransferase, NSD2 methyltransferase, and other proteins play a role in preventing cellular senescence. So far, no biomarker specific to senescent cells has been discovered. It is now a question of how can we understand the cellular senescence process. Thus, the researchers reviewed cellular senescence over time and in terms of the characteristics of protein-secreting SASPs.  
&gt;  
&gt;They realized that there are at least four phenotypic variations (states) in cellular senescence: 1. initiation (proliferation arrest), 2. early (anti-inflammation), 3. full (increased inflammation and metabolism), and 4. late (decreased inflammation and metabolism). Focusing on the molecular level changes for each period, they showed that variations in cellular senescence may be shaped by a ""senescent program"" in which the change of intracellular metabolism and epigenomics (gene ON/OFF control) takes place in a coordinated manner.  
&gt;  
&gt;The researchers then focused on transcriptional and epigenomic factors that regulate the expression of genes that play important functions in the process of cellular senescence. During the initiation state, genes that promote cell proliferation are suppressed, while genes that block proliferation are activated. It is known that the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) play a major role in this process. In the early state, cell morphology changes significantly and cytokines with anti-inflammatory properties are activated. This may be a defense against the later inflammatory action. Then, in the full state, the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines become highly expressed and produce a strong inflammatory response. At the same time, the expression of metabolic genes, such as mitochondria, and genes that synthesize proteins are increased via the aforementioned Rb. Here, it is thought that metabolic reactions produce the energy needed to synthesize and secrete proteins. Finally, in the late state, the inflammatory response and metabolism decline, but interferon is produced and secreted in response to the cytoplasmic DNA fragments of the nuclear genome and mitochondrial DNA. At present, the mechanisms and significance of these processes are still unidentified, but it is now understood that cellular senescence results in a qualitatively different inflammatory response.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We hope that our work will provide an opportunity for the scientific community to consider a new understanding of the mechanisms of cellular senescence and body aging,"" said Professor Mitsuyoshi Nakao. ""We believe that phenotypic variation in cellular senescence can lead to new methods to promote healthy longevity and the control and prevention age-related diseases.""",1,1603810216,longevity

&gt;4923 patients (2790 men, 2133 women) with type 2 diabetes (mean age, 66 years) were followed prospectively (median, 5.3 years; follow-up rate, 99.5%). We evaluated the amount of green tea and coffee consumed using self-administered questionnaires.

&gt;**Conclusions** Higher consumption of green tea and coffee was associated with **reduced all-cause mortality**: their combined effect appeared to be additive in patients with type 2 diabetes.


This is in addition to what we already know about coffee consumption.

Dr. Jeff Peng has the following summary of coffee.

https://www.jeffreypengmd.com/post/coffee

Remember, some people think the **only** active ingredient in coffee / tea is caffeine.  This is a mistake.

Also, these drinks have additive effects, so likely not just more of one compound.

-------------------

**Significance of this study**

**What is already known about this subject?**

 Higher green tea or coffee consumption has been reported to confer health benefits, and reduce all-cause mortality in the general population, respectively.

  No studies have investigated the association between green tea consumption and mortality in diabetic patients, and few studies have examined the association between coffee consumption and mortality in diabetic patients, and the results are controversial.

**What are the new findings?**

  Higher consumption of green tea and coffee was associated with reduced all-cause mortality.

  The combined effect of green tea and coffee on mortality appeared to be additive in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?**

  This study suggests that consuming green tea and coffee may have beneficial effects on the longevity of Japanese people with type 2 diabetes.",1,1603386972,longevity

&gt; With continued advances in science and technology, there is great potential to extend our healthspan as we age.
&gt; 
&gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; **Global aging stands to fundamentally impact how families, communities, societies, industries, and economies function. As illustrated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the vulnerabilities of older populations to emerging pandemics and noncommunicable diseases and to maximize the number of years lived in good health.**
&gt; 
&gt; Through the Global Roadmap for Healthy Longevity and the Healthy Longevity Global Competition, NAM seeks to lay the groundwork for a new global vision around healthy aging, catalyzing new medicines, treatments, technologies, and preventive and social strategies that could help to transform the way we age. Healthy longevity as the norm is within reach through contemporary societies collectively working to tackle this global grand challenge.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; Treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a prominent strategy to address the age-related decline in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels for maintaining aspects of late-life health. It is assumed that exogenous NMN is directly incorporated into NAD+ in mammals by the canonical recycling pathway, however the need for NAD+ is conserved across evolution, including bacteria in the gut microbiome, which can deamidate NMN to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). 

&gt; Here, we use strategic isotope labelling studies to demonstrate a role for the gut microbiome in deamidating orally delivered NMN into NaMN prior to its uptake and incorporation in mammals. Microbiome depletion increased the overall abundance of NAD metabolites, suggesting a competition relationship. 

&gt; Strikingly, treatment with labelled NMN increased the production of unlabelled NAD precursors, with a greater than 3-fold increase in endogenous NR levels in the gut of antibiotics treated animals upon labelled NMN treatment. 

&gt; These data suggest that exogenous NMN impacts the NAD metabolome through indirect means, rather than through its direct incorporation, including through the production of endogenous NR via an as-yet unidentified pathway, and demonstrate an important role for the gut microbiome in the assimilation of orally delivered NMN.",1,1603283024,longevity

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; The biological bases of longevity are not well understood, and there are limited biomarkers for the prediction of long life. We used a high‐throughput, discovery‐based proteomics approach to identify serum peptides and proteins that were associated with the attainment of longevity in a longitudinal study of community‐dwelling men age ≥65 years. Baseline serum in 1196 men were analyzed using liquid chromatography–ion mobility–mass spectrometry, and lifespan was determined during ~12 years of follow‐up. Men who achieved longevity (≥90% expected survival) were compared to those who died earlier. Rigorous statistical methods that controlled for false positivity were utilized to identify 25 proteins that were associated with longevity. All these proteins were in lower abundance in long‐lived men and included a variety involved in inflammation or complement activation. Lower levels of longevity‐associated proteins were also associated with better health status, but as time to death shortened, levels of these proteins increased. Pathway analyses implicated a number of compounds as important upstream regulators of the proteins and implicated shared networks that underlie the observed associations with longevity. Overall, these results suggest that complex pathways, prominently including inflammation, are linked to the likelihood of attaining longevity. This work may serve to identify novel biomarkers for longevity and to understand the biology underlying lifespan.",1,1603273082,longevity

* The funding bodies don't care to even read up on rejuvenation, so they just go ""hah!

You're allowed to apply for funding for gene-therapy, but do not EVER mention aging. You have to say you're going to target molecule XYZ which is a byproduct of the nutrient YZX with gene-therapy ZYX. But then of course, since there are a dozen or more different aggregates that causes lets say blood clots in your brain, the funding body will likely deny your application ""because this would only target one of the causes"". And then if you apply for funding to deal with all of the aggregates with one gene therapy each they say ""that's too much money and we don't think you'll be able to successfully make gene-therapies for all of these things in the allotted time"".

Cause I forsaw an issue and came here to share the advice about testing for its research. I merely wanted to seed an insight into the memesphere for forward.

Since this would help keep a tragedy from being a less natural method, as I also thought that perhaps their was a natural method to the same end of here. But I didn't know their was one known.

Although I wonder if my impulsive satisfactions based on instinct as a primitive doggo satisfy my health needs by replenishing craved needs prescisely. So perhaps it also explains my lower aging rate then average for a meth addict anyways. 

Since I look better then last year when I had just started, it seems my face aged then reverted. But it was also shapeshifting later on from noted atypical donnie darko like behavior with frankbunny. But much like the meth symptoms, this ended eventually.

I went to a wedding yesterday completely sober, it was fine I felt perfectly good after a 2 week binge.

So I guess I found a way to modify body, infact instead of going up to smoking it, I went back to eating it after snorting so it takes longer to activate. I also didn't up my dosage habit, stayed the same.

So I might have hit tolerance bottom like adhd meds. But I guess thats what an eldritch dog deman does for his longevity, by evolutionary self body adaption. I just modify my internal pain sensations to fix them, since I can reach into there and user fix it myself.

Its like twitching your flesh with your impulses to get the damage to stop hurting so its not damaged anymore and then ensuring it stays such after.

1. There's two types of paradigms or ""industry's"" - one is the industry that works to develop things to SLOW AGING, and one is working to REVERSE AGING.
   1. Most of David Sinclair's work published right now is in SLOWING AGING. He is developing molecules that work in the same way that calorie restriction and exercise do to slow the process of aging. These molecules, when they are tweaked enough to work for people, will be super useful as they will essentially bring everyone up to the level of aging that we can get to today with diet and exercise and will be universally prescribed so the potential market here is huge, but effects on people will not be as dramatic as the....

(Is this right? NMN and sirtuins only slow aging, right?)

1. The REVERSE AGING Market is based on reversing the cellular damage caused by aging. What aging is, is defined and mostly accepted by people the ""Hallmarks of Aging"" Paper ([LINK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/)) . David Sinclair is certiainly working towards this and he was able to genetically repogram mouse eyes to grow back and be young which you should google and check out, but he hasn't got anything right now.
   1. Basically, there are 9 types of damage. Those types are Genomic Instability, Telomere Attrition, Epigenetic Alterations, Loss of Proteostasis, Deregulated Nutrient -Sensing, Mitochondrial Dsyfunction, Cellular Senescence, Stem Cell Exhaustion, Altered Intercellular Communication. This paper gets cited pretty much everyday ( what's most interesting is that Aubrey de Grey figured out most of this stuff 5 years before the ""regular"" scientific community did).
   2. Start-up Companies in the ""Reverse Aging"" sphere right now are looking at one of these types of damage and are trying to develop technology to reverse it. They usually do so based off of one ""use-case"" that is a hallmark of the disease of old age, like osteoarthritis or macular degeneration.
   3. So far, there is no ""Reverse Aging"" science that is proven in humans, so everything in this industry is highly risky but these types of companies are going to be way more valuable because reversing damage is way way way better than slowing it and will be needed for pretty much everyone alive right now. Companies developing these types of technologies are where we need to put our money, because it's only after we solve most of these problems that we will start seeing exponentially longer ""health spans'

&gt; The quality of romantic relationships can be predictive of health consequences related to aging. DNA methylation-based biomarkers of aging have been developed for humans and many other mammals and could be used to assess how pair bonding impacts aging.  Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) have emerged as a model to study social attachment among adult pairs. 

&gt; Here we describe DNA methylation-based estimators of age for prairie voles based on novel DNA methylation data generated on highly conserved mammalian CpGs measured with a custom array. The multi-tissue epigenetic clock for voles was trained on 3 tissue sources (ear, liver, and samples of brain tissue from within the pair bonding circuit). A novel dual species human-vole clock accurately measured relative age defined as the ratio of chronological age to maximum age. 

&gt; According to the human-vole clock of relative age, sexually inexperienced voles exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging in brain tissue (p = 0.02) when compared to pair bonded animals of the same chronological age. Epigenome wide association studies identified CpGs in four genes that were strongly associated with pair bonding across the three tissue types (brain, ear, and liver): Hnrnph1, Fancl, Fam13b, and Fzd1. Further, four CpGs (near the Bmp4 exon, Eif4g2 3 prime UTR, Robo1 exon, and Nfat5 intron) exhibited a convergent methylation change between pair bonding and aging.

But if I had to guess, I would say that anybody below 25/26 is going to be a bad bet because they probably are at peak health and don't care much about it.   


That being said, I think the best age is right after that, right around 30 and up. 30 year olds will have seen just a little bit of decline and want nothing of it, and they will have the most to benefit from taking action now.  So that's my answer. Maybe we can work with those companies to target google ads / facebook ads towards that crowd?   


Also, I think the public company investing is the way to go. Personally, I am way happier contributing to a company than a charity because a company that could actually solve this problem will become very rich. I am much more likely to contribute more money towards that cause and besides that, companies are organized towards concrete accomplishments whereas charities are sort of more nebulous.

,jansen1975,"From Michael Fossel a researcher focused on telomeres and telomerase.

&gt;**Misguided approaches to measuring telomeres**  
&gt;  
&gt;About once every two weeks, I receive a research article that goes something like this. The authors measured the telomeres of several dozen volunteers, then performed an intervention (changed the diet, taught them meditation, increased their daily exercise, etc.), then measured the telomeres again in six months, and found that the telomeres had lengthened. They conclude that the intervention lengthens telomeres (and, by implication, reverses aging). While they might be right, the data prove certainly don’t justify their conclusions. If they are right, they are right despite poor design, poor analysis, poor thinking, and a very shaky knowledge of cells. There are several problems these types of study, starting with the fact that almost every one of these studies only measures telomere lengths in white blood cells, which are easy to obtain, but not particularly useful (nor are they valid or reliable, as we’ll see).  
&gt;  
&gt;The first problem is that even if they truly lengthened the telomeres in those white blood cells (and see below), most of us die of aging cells in our arteries or aging cells in our brains (not to mention the problems we have with our joints, our bones, our kidneys, etc.). Measuring the telomeres in white cells tells us precisely nothing about these more important cells and tissues. It’s much like using hair color (how gray is your hair?) to assess your risk for having a heart attack or Alzheimer’s disease. White cells are the wrong cells to look at. They may be easy to get, but they don’t get you anywhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;The second problem is that white cells are a dynamic population and they respond to almost any stress by dividing (and shortening their telomeres). Once the stress is gone, the white cells get replaced by “younger” white cells (with longer telomeres) from the stem cells in your bone marrow. So, you might say that if you only measure your white cell telomeres, then you will appear older as a result of any stress and you will appear younger again once the stress goes away. For example, you will appear to have older white cells if you have an infection, if you just had a loved one die, if you lost your job, or if you are malnourished. The opposite is equally true: your white cells will appear younger if your stress resolves, since your white cells will then be replaced with “younger” cells from the stem cell compartment in your bone marrow. Note that if we actually measured your bone marrow cells (and not the circulating white cells), you would find that your hematopoietic stem cells are slowly aging almost regardless of what you do. Whether we cure your infection, improve your diet, make you exercise regularly, or have you meditate, makes little difference to your marrow cells. Almost any clinical intervention might affect your circulating white cells, but there is no evidence that any intervention can make your stem cells younger (or can increase their telomeres). To focus on the white cell telomeres is an illusion. This is not to say that these various interventions aren’t useful and may not improve your health, but there is no evidence that any of these interventions make you any younger. For that matter, there may be evidence that these interventions change the particular white cells you sample (so the new sample has longer telomeres), but there is no evidence that these interventions lengthen telomeres, let alone make you any younger.  
&gt;  
&gt;To give you an analogy, imagine that you are trying to make people younger in a large country (the US, for example), so you measure the average age in a particular block of a major city (Boston, for example), then you perform an intervention (an urban renewal program, for example) over several decades (between 1950 and 2018, for example), then measure the average age of people living in that same block. The average age may well be lower in 2018 than it was in 1950, but that does NOT mean that you have made anyone get younger and it certainly doesn’t mean that the rest of the country is now younger. The population has changed: some people moved out, some moved in and those that moved in tended to be younger.  
&gt;  
&gt;The same thing happens when you measure white cell telomeres: the old white cells are gone, and new white cells have “moved into the block”. To conclude that you have made the white cells (let alone the whole body) younger is silly, to say nothing of entirely unsupported by the data. This is not to say that the various interventions purported to affect telomeres and/or aging (meditation, vegetarian diets, exercise, or in one case, living in zero gravity) may not have physical benefits (or that they might actually affect telomeres or aging), but that not a single one of these various interventions has valid data to answer those questions. Measuring peripheral white cell telomere lengths is not only fraught with errors, but (at least as far as most current research goes) has approximately the same validity as casting a horoscope.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, most telomere measurements are done by average length, which is relatively cheap but not particularly relevant. Tissue function is highly dependent upon the oldest (not the average) cells in the tissue and cell function is highly dependent upon the shortest (not the average) telomere in the cells. Measuring the average telomere may be cheap and easy, but it’s like trying to figure out the risk of terrorism in a city by measuring the average person. The average person isn’t a terrorist, but that’s not the point. It’s the extremes that determine the overall risk of terrorism in a community. It only takes a few terrorists to result in disaster and, in your tissues, it only takes a few senescent cells to result in disease. Within the cells, it only takes a few short telomeres to result in a dysfunctional cell. The upshot is that when we measure telomere lengths, the measurement that is most often used is the measurement that doesn’t tell you what you know. The result is that most studies measure the wrong thing and then, with perfect confidence, draw the entirely unwarranted conclusions. No wonder the literature is misleading.

Abstract:

&gt; The field of aging research has grown rapidly over the last half-century, with advancement of scientific technologies to interrogate mechanisms underlying the benefit of life-extending interventions like calorie restriction (CR). Coincident with this increase in knowledge has been the rise of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), both associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Given the difficulty in practicing long-term CR, a search for compounds (CR mimetics) which could recapitulate the health and longevity benefits without requiring food intake reductions was proposed. 

&gt; Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are compounds that function predominantly within the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymatic digestion of complex carbohydrates, delaying and decreasing monosaccharide uptake from the gut in the treatment of T2D. Acarbose, an AGI, has been shown in pre-clinical models to increase lifespan (greater longevity benefits in males), with decreased body weight gain independent of calorie intake reduction. 

&gt; The CR mimetic benefits of acarbose are further supported by clinical findings beyond T2D including the risk for other age-related diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular). Open questions remain regarding the exclusivity of acarbose relative to other AGIs, potential off-target effects, and combination with other therapies for healthy aging and longevity extension.  

&gt; Given the promising results in pre-clinical models (even in the absence of T2D), a unique mechanism of action and multiple age-related reduced disease risks that have been reported with acarbose, support for clinical trials with acarbose focusing on aging-related outcomes and incorporating biological sex, age at treatment initiation, and T2D-dependence within the design is warranted.",1,1601763004,longevity

&gt; An open letter from the European Longevity Initiative

&gt; We, at the European Longevity Initiative, would like express our opinion concerning the proposed ~10% last minute European Research Council (ERC) budget cuts as it amounts to less chance for ground-breaking scientific and medical research providing health benefits for the world, Europeans included.

&gt; Fact #1: As the Nature Editorial A pandemic is no time to cut the European Research Council’s funding puts it:

&gt; “The ERC is a rare success story in multilateral research funding. About 25% of all patents filed by projects supported by Horizon 2020 have come from ERC projects, even though commercialization of research is not the agency’s main aim….

&gt; “The ERC is seen as stellar by the standards of basic research agencies. According to the latest evaluation report, almost one-fifth of projects report a breakthrough and more than half lead to a major scientific advance [1].”

&gt; Fact #2: EU leaders agreed in May for a budget of 14.7 billion.

&gt; Fact #3: It has been cut by €1.3 billion (US$1.5 billion) the last minute.

&gt; Problem: This budget cut means potentially less health for European Citizens in the medium and long term as it provides less chance for new, innovative, clinically relevant research. For instance it weakens the chances for bigger, successful grants addressing the root cause of age-associated diseases, biological aging, which needs multidisciplinary skills pulled from a cross-European talent pool, multilateral research founding and potentially an interdisciplinary approach.

&gt; This short-sighted budget u turn is also in tension with the new slogans emerging from EU leaders on focusing on public health in general.",1,1601585215,longevity

From the article:

&gt; “We’ve published one study that in at least the context of obesity, finds exercise can prevent senescent cell accumulation and, to some extent, clear senescent cells from the body,” says Dr. LeBrasseur. “Exercise has profound effects on our cells and their capacity to repair different aspects of cell damage that are linked to aging and age-related diseases. For example, exercise improves the cells’ ability to repair DNA, manage oxidative stress, and turn on the garbage disposal and get rid of old damaged proteins.”

&gt; It may sound rote, but Dr. LeBrasseur says the guidelines recommended to maintain overall good health also apply to aging: 30-minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise most days of the week could benefit the body’s ability to maintain its regenerative potential, and therefore could be like turning the clock back on aging. In contrast, lack of exercise and unhealthy eating are linked to age-related cell damage and chronic disease.

&gt; “Exercise is regenerative medicine,” Dr. LeBrasseur says.

&gt; Based on the findings from work in animal models, human studies are now underway.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; There is a great deal of debate on the question of whether or not we know what ageing is (Ref. Cohen et al). Here, we consider what we believe to be the especially confused and confusing case of the ageing of the human immune system, commonly referred to as “immunosenescence”. But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications. 

&gt; Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity. 

&gt; Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy. Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: 

&gt; * (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed; 

&gt; * (2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age; 

&gt; * (3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging; and 

&gt; * (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate aging. 

&gt; This remains an immense challenge. These questions acquire an added urgency in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, given the clearly greater susceptibility of older adults to COVID-19.


&amp;nbsp;

**Highlights**

&gt; * Biomarkers of human immunosenescence are discussed

&gt; * Longitudinal studies are essential

&gt; * Associations of immune markers in older adults with clinical outcome are context-dependent

&gt; * There are no universal biomarkers of human immunosenescence

&gt; * There are common age-associated changes to peripheral immune markers in humans

It compromises the health and function of neighboring cells and the surrounding tissue,” says Dr. LeBrasseur. **“In the field of aging, we often talk about inflammation as a primary cause of disease. Factors secreted by senescent cells clearly contribute to a state of chronic sterile inflammation, or a smoldering fire, which can burst into a conflagration and drive disease.”**

This fire analogy though.

&gt; Mayo Clinic research has found that removing senescent cells could halt the aging process and restore tissue regeneration in an organism. Through both genetic and pharmacological strategies, researchers have shown senescent cell clearance improves age-related diseases of the lung, bones, vasculature, brain, kidney, liver and other organs.

&gt; Abstract

&gt;One of the key issues facing public healthcare is the global trend of an increasingly ageing society which continues to present policy makers and caregivers with formidable healthcare and socio-economic challenges. Ageing is the primary contributor to a broad spectrum of chronic disorders all associated with a lower quality of life in the elderly. **In 2019, the Chinese population constituted 18 % of the world population, with 164.5 million Chinese citizens aged 65 and above (65+), and 26 million aged 80 or above (80+).** China has become an ageing society, and as it continues to age it will continue to exacerbate the burden borne by current family and public healthcare systems. Major healthcare challenges involved with caring for the elderly in China include the management of chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs), physical frailty, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, with emerging challenges such as providing sufficient dental care, combating the rising prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among nursing home communities, providing support for increased incidences of immune diseases, and the growing necessity to provide palliative care for the elderly. 

&gt; At the governmental level, it is necessary to make long-term strategic plans to respond to the pressures of an ageing society, especially to establish a nationwide, affordable, annual health check system to facilitate early diagnosis and provide access to affordable treatments. China has begun work on several activities to address these issues including the recent completion of the of the Ten-year Health-Care Reform project, the implementation of the Healthy China 2030 Action Plan, and the opening of the National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders. There are also societal challenges, namely the shift from an extended family system in which the younger provide home care for their elderly family members, to the current trend in which young people are increasingly migrating towards major cities for work, increasing reliance on nursing homes to compensate, especially following the outcomes of the ‘one child policy’ and the ‘empty-nest elderly’ phenomenon. At the individual level, it is important to provide avenues for people to seek and improve their own knowledge of health and disease, to encourage them to seek medical check-ups to prevent/manage illness, and to find ways to promote modifiable health-related behaviors (social activity, exercise, healthy diets, reasonable diet supplements) to enable healthier, happier, longer, and more productive lives in the elderly. 

&gt; **Finally, at the technological or treatment level, there is a focus on modern technologies to counteract the negative effects of ageing. Researchers are striving to produce drugs that can mimic the effects of ‘exercising more, eating less’, while other anti-ageing molecules from molecular gerontologists could help to improve ‘healthspan’ in the elderly. Machine learning, ‘Big Data’, and other novel technologies can also be used to monitor disease patterns at the population level and may be used to inform policy design in the future.** Collectively, synergies across disciplines on policies, geriatric care, drug development, personal awareness, the use of big data, machine learning and personalized medicine will transform China into a country that enables the most for its elderly, maximizing and celebrating their longevity in the coming decades.

We outline the numerous mitophagic receptors and triggers, with a focus on basal and physiologically relevant cues, offering insight into why they lead to mitochondrial removal. We also explore how mitophagy maintains mitochondrial homeostasis at the organ and system levels and how a loss of mitophagy may play a role in a diverse group of diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases. With disrupted mitophagy affecting such a wide array of physiological processes, a deeper understanding of how to modulate mitophagy could provide avenues for numerous therapies.",1,1600609663,longevity

It's definetly fucking ridiculous, it's obviously not the fair market rate. This is one of many market inefficiencies. If this happens occasionally and has consequences for the hospitals charging this much, all is well. If it is systemic, then you have to start asking questions.


So now the question is why is the market inefficient here. The answer is that someone in need of immediate medical attention has no time to shop around for the best rates in a 20mile radius, or to negotiate. It's eat or die. This **does** work for most medication, but not here.



Here in a working system people should negotiate with / chose their insurance provider to cover the expenses (beforehand, obviously). Then insurance companies would, in a functioning market, negotiate on behalf of their clients to get a low rate (because insurance pays part of the cost). And an insurance company does have the leverage to negotiate with hospitals (i.e. ""we stop covering XYZ surgery here and then people will go to another hospital"")

 


But this requires:

•Rational actors as consumers/patients/customers


•A competetive insurance marketplace (this is the biggest issue)


•perfect contracts, i.e. just because the insursnce provider is forced to pay something in your contract, doesn't mean you have the means/time/money to actually make them. Because courts can't just objevtively review all facts in an instant and make a judgement.



Now why there is and isn't a competetive health insurance marketplace is a difficult topic involving politics and game theory. It needs way more knowledge of the specific laws, regulations, history and culture of the USA than I have (which is close to zero). 


And that's the debate really worth having. I *suspect* (I have no data to back this up) that it's ""basic"" regulatory capture (=corruption, bribery) of a few big insurance companies to keep out smaller competition by tons of regulation that are just bearable for them, but devastating to anyone else.


Imo fixing this underlying issue would be the better choice over just having a price ceiling on saline bags, but one is easier to implement and easier to sell to the public than ""we have to clean out decades of corruption in our own ranks"".

From the discussion:

&gt;In this work, we performed untargeted metabolomic analysis to
compare the effects of CR in animals housed at two different Ta.
One was 22°C, which approximately corresponds to the standard
“room temperature” housing conditions at which experiments are
typically performed in laboratories across the world. The other was
30°C, a temperature at which most mammals, including mice and
humans, are thermoneutral. The rationale for our study is that thermoneutrality exacerbates inflammatory and metabolic disorders (20–22),
prevents the hypothermic response to CR, and antagonizes the beneficial effects that CR has on longevity (23).

&gt;The 50% CR used here can be considered a model of severe
CR. Experiments investigating the beneficial effects of CR on life
span typically provide 60% of the AL diet or more. However, such
regimens are usually applied for the entire duration of the life-span
experiments. Here, we subjected animals to 75% CR (animals received 25% less of the amount of food consumed AL) for 4 days
followed by 50% CR for 8 days. The regimen and time points were
chosen because a parameter we wanted to investigate was the reduction
of core body temperature that occurs during CR at room temperature but not at thermoneutrality, and such a hypothermic response
is larger at 50% CR, compared to milder CR regimens. However, in
moving forward with the investigation, it will be important to determine if the changes observed here on a 50% CR regimen applied for
8 days are similar to those that may be induced by a milder CR regimen
and for longer periods of time.

&gt;....

&gt;We showed in animals subjected to long-term CR how the prevention of the CR-induced hypothermia facilitates body weight loss
by limiting the hypothermic response that reduces energy expenditure (40). During the short-term CR used here, body weight was still
similar in CR animals housed at room temperature and at thermoneutrality (fig. S1A). In addition, no differences were found in the
lean–to–body weight and fat–to–body weight ratio in groups of
animals housed at room temperature or at thermoneutrality (fig. S1B).
These data, together with the fact that samples were collected 20 hours
after the last meal, indicate that the effects of food on the metabolome
were minimized and that the experimental setting offered a reasonable platform to investigate the metabolites and pathways associated
with temperature. We anticipated that changes in the metabolome
may be used to investigate at least two biological functions: pathways that may contribute to the beneficial effects of CR on longevity
and those that may be involved in regulating the hypothermic response to CR. The first set of pathways is more likely to be identified
by evaluating the changes found in the plasma, which was used as
an index of systemic changes. The latter set of pathways could be
identified by evaluating changes occurring in the hypothalamus because this brain region is pivotal in regulating temperature homeostasis. In this study, validation was carried out for metabolites involved in the regulation of the hypothermic response to CR.

&gt;We found that thermoneutrality reversed 39% of those metabolic
changes observed in plasma upon CR and 78% of those in the hypothalamus. In both tissues, these changes were primarily due to amino
acids and their derivatives and, to a lesser extent, due to lipids and
energy metabolites as demonstrated with the total FFA and acylcarnitine levels (Fig. 4, C and D). One way to interpret these data is by considering that reduced calorie intake triggers the use of stored energy
and that such energetic requirement is different in animals housed
at distinct Ta, because thermoneutrality reduces the energetic cost
required to maintaining a constant Tb (11). Thus, the 75% decrease
in lipid-energy metabolite correlations in plasma at thermoneutrality
is a likely indication that mice at 30°C do not need as much acylcarnitines as mice at 22°C to produce energy through b-oxidation
(Fig. 3B). The alteration in amino acids can, in part, also be interpreted in terms of energy requirements because gluconeogenesis
from free amino acids mainly in the liver has been described as a
mechanism to maintain glucose levels during CR (31, 32). Plasma
glucogenic amino acids may be shuttled to the liver and/or other
glucogenic organs to be converted into the different intermediates
of gluconeogenesis, potentially explaining that decrease in plasma
during CR regulates energy balance. In addition, prolonged dietary
restriction can activate protein catabolism in muscles, increasing
the level of circulating free amino acids, which can be used as an
alternative source of energy for gluconeogenesis (56). Markers of
muscle catabolism were higher at 22°C (Fig. 4, G and H).",2,1600460566,longevity

There's no social aspect to it, we don't want to revolutionize anything, we don't have anything to say about rights etc. This strategy is purely based on science and frankly, common sense.

A. the distinction between aging and age-related diseases is meaningless and hinders progress. This distinction is blinding us to the underlying causes and has at best a palliative effect. Case in point: our hearts start malfunctioning, let's say the rhythm becomes pathological and what to we do: we prescribe among other thing beta blockers (not always of course, there's rules and (gold) standards and a lot of details that must be known before a doctor actually prescribes that). The best beta blocker that you can imagine would be:

* perfectly specific for the receptors
* have no side effects
* have zero toxicity
* perfectly controllable effect duration/intensity.
We don't have that ideal beta blocker and we probably never will. The sad thing is that even that perfect beta blocker will not do shit to treat the underlying condition that causes the heart disease. Can we maybe just fucking stop throwing money at the 4th and 5th-99th generation of beta blockers and just try to repair the damage, remove the cardiac amyloid etc.?! 
 
B. Aging is a physical process (an unfortunate consequence of being alive), as inevitable as rust, and can be solved through an engineering approach: repair and maintain.

C. You need to tackle simultaneously different types of damage in order to regain/maintain health. Again the car analogy: you wouldn't just change the oil and never the tires or battery etc.

The only reason SENS approach would be a movement is because it's a good idea. It's too good actually and makes people uncomfortable: ""Can we stay healthy longer and live longer too? Preposterous! Thrice I prescribed a beta blocker and once a diuretic. I had a good life."" :) People who feel uncomfortable seek comfort in others that alleviate their stress and isolate themselves from the source of their distress.

&gt; A recent cluster of sudden cardiac deaths in marathon runners has attracted considerable media attention and evoked concern over the safety of long-distance running and competition. This review discusses the acute and potential long-term risks associated with marathon running and puts these into perspective with the many health benefits afforded by habitual vigorous exercise.

&gt; Marathon running is associated with a transient and low risk of sudden cardiac death. This risk appears to be even lower in women and is independent of marathon experience or the presence of previously reported symptoms. Most deaths are due to underlying coronary artery disease. The value of preparticipation screening is limited by its insensitivity and impracticality of widespread implementation. Appropriate preparation and deployment of trained medical personnel and availability of automatic external defibrillators are expected to have a major impact on survival from cardiac arrests during marathons. Cardiac biochemical and functional abnormalities are commonly observed transiently following completion of a marathon, although their clinical significance is unknown.

&gt; Sudden cardiac deaths associated with marathon running are exceedingly rare events. Prevention should focus on recognition and investigation of prodromal symptoms, if present, and access to rapid defibrillation and trained medical personnel.

,StoicOptom,"TLDR: New aging clocks derived from machine learning, based on measures of frailty, separately predicts healthspan and lifespan.

&gt; Abstract

&gt; The identification of genes and interventions that slow or reverse aging is hampered by the lack of non-invasive metrics that can predict the life expectancy of pre-clinical models. Frailty Indices (FIs) in mice are composite measures of health that are cost-effective and non-invasive, but whether they can accurately predict health and lifespan is not known. Here, mouse FIs are scored longitudinally until death and machine learning is employed to develop two clocks. A random forest regression is trained on FI components for chronological age to generate the FRIGHT (Frailty Inferred Geriatric Health Timeline) clock, a strong predictor of chronological age. A second model is trained on remaining lifespan to generate the AFRAID (Analysis of Frailty and Death) clock, which accurately predicts life expectancy and the efficacy of a lifespan-extending intervention up to a year in advance. Adoption of these clocks should accelerate the identification of longevity genes and aging interventions.


Cute video by first author on how to measure mice frailty for input into their 'AFRAID' and 'FRIGHT' aging clocks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTgk8wbUd1g

Measuring biological age can predict risk of disease incidence and progression, or even mortality. Aging clocks that are superior to conventional measures (e.g. frailty index or chronological age) by determining an individual's rate of aging could better predict various health outcomes.

The AFRAID clock measures healthspan (better than using a frailty index), while the FRIGHT clock predicts lifespan. 

AFRAID:
They were able to validate this clock by showing that enalapril, a blood pressure lowering drug that improves healthspan but not lifespan, affected the AFRAID clock but not the FRIGHT clock.

FRIGHT:
Validation with methionine restriction, which is known to slow aging (and hence improve *both* healthspan and lifespan), showed that FRIGHT predicted the increases in healthspan and lifespan.

While not yet validated in humans, aging clocks could be of immense utility in medicine because they could assist triage in acute care (e.g. identifying who needs intensive care for Covid-19), eligibility for surgery, and inform clinical decision making of doctors.

More importantly, measuring biological age would help cliinical trials quickly identify whether drugs that slow/reverse aging in animals work similarly in humans, without having to wait for age-related outcomes like stroke or cancer that take years to develop in expensive clinical trials.",6,1600213002,longevity

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

This is a tangent but I gotta say it:

Man, idk about you, but after discussing this for so long, I have started to get the sinking feeling that all human behavior may have an evolutionary basis. I mean what else could explain it. We are definitely still evolving. There are still many threats to our health and we still compete for mates. I think social behavior definitely has an evolutionary basis, and people have an ulterior motive, which many times they are not even conscious of, but which is driven by selective forces. Friendship, reciprocation, and collaborative behaviors definitely are advantageous to groups that do so, versus groups that are more selfish and solitary. They are even more advantageous to the individual over time, if that individual is in need they can rely on others. Similarly, if an individual ceases to contribute to the survival of the group by not gathering/hunting food to share (modern equivalent of working), not defending other members of the group, etc. then they will be less valued by the group. 

When it comes to behaviors like fighting, exercising for fun, playing games, etc. they all serve evolutionary purposes and have been observed in other animals.  

I think perhaps systems of morality and societally acceptable behaviors can also be explained by evolution, as can tourism, pet owning, etc. Though in these cases they are not necessarily driven by natural selection but are a product of traits that evolved in the distant past for some purpose that was advantageous. 

And also, just looking at this conversation we are having, it is intellectually stimulating, but really, we are trying to get to the truth of the matter, as elucidating the basis for aging in evolution will probably lead research in a more frugal direction, and we both want to live longer.",1,1600200373,longevity

when initiated later in life. The editors of Science selected this discovery as one of the top
ten scientific breakthroughs in 2009 (Science 326, 1602-3, 2009). 

&gt; This was the first time a
discovery in aging was recognized by the scientific community as a major breakthrough in
science. Two years after the discovery that rapamycin increased the lifespan of mice, a
second discovery in aging was selected by Science as one of the top ten scientific
breakthroughs (Science 334, 1635, 2011). van Deursen‟s group discovered that genetically
removing senescent cells postponed age-related disease in mice (38).

studies have shown that rapamycin increases the lifespan of various strains of mice (33, 39),
demonstrating the robustness of the effect of rapamycin on lifespan of mice. Rapamycin

,hplus-club,"&gt; David Sinclair believes in an antagonistic plietropy theory of aging. I don’t know if you are familiar with this theory, but basically it is that the traits which favor better health and ability to mate and produce offspring when we are young have a cost. That cost, or trade-off is aging faster, and having poorer health as we get older. He is not the first to propose this theory, and it does have some evidence. For example, dietary restriction makes a person weaker physically and has some down sides when we are young, but seems to result in a longer lifespan and better health when we are old.

Yes, I heard this argument many times and I also believe it is wrong. All the examples I've heard of can be explained easily in a different way. That calorie restriction increases lifespan is strong evidence that aging is programmed. Food scarcity means that offspring has a lower chance of survival. Thus, organisms need to reprogram their aging speed to increase their lifespan, to improve their chance of reaching the optimal number of offspring. To optimize evolvability every species has an optimal number of offspring for individual members. If the number is too small, the species might get extinct, if the number is too big innovation slows down because the gene pool becomes ""contaminated"" with very similar genomes, that is, genetic diversity goes down. 

Obviously, genetic diversity is important for the survival of the species (think of pathogens) and it is important for the change of the species because genetic diversity increases the likelihood for innovation. I have to add that it is assumed here that every species has limited resources available at a given time which limits the possible size of the gene pool. This is why it is important to maximize diversity by limiting the number of offspring for individuals of the species. Obviously, aging is incredibly helpful here.

With regard to the limited resources, I highly recommend the reading of Josh Mitteldorf's book *Cracking the Aging Code*. He discusses this factor of evolution in detail.",1,1599844969,longevity
,ManBroSON,"Wow. Okay, thanks for clearing up your belief about turnover rate.

As, far as the rest goes, we disagree. 

Most literature I have read states that aging is most likely not selected for by evolution. In fact, aging should be selected against, since a longer lived human in better health should be able to produce more progeny. 

Thus, the consensus seems to be that while aging might be programmed, it is probably simply the case that a mutation that prevents aging, such as in a certain species of jellyfish , has not occurred in humans.

Perhaps I was unclear in my definition of evolution, but by “continuation of a species” I meant change which allows continued survival of the species. You see, humans have evolved a diversity of traits by living in a diversity of niches. For example, darker pigment of the skin is selected for in regions with more intense sunlight, whereas lighter pigment is selected for in areas with less.  

But, I don’t see why aging would be beneficial to promote this kind of change. In fact, like I said earlier, if there was a mutation that prevented aging, it would actually be selected for, assuming it did not have negative side effects. 

But perhaps this is too big of an assumption to make. 

David Sinclair believes in an antagonistic plietropy theory of aging. I don’t know if you are familiar with this theory, but basically it is that the traits which favor better health and ability to mate and produce offspring when we are young have a cost. That cost, or trade-off is aging faster, and having poorer health as we get older. He is not the first to propose this theory, and it does have some evidence. For example, dietary restriction makes a person weaker physically and has some down sides when we are young, but seems to result in a longer lifespan and better health when we are old. Thus, a person who has a metabolism that does this already might not be as competitive when it comes to competing to reproduce, but would live longer, and therefore this trait might be selected against. I’m not sure I can fully get behind this theory unless there was more compelling evidence, like anti-aging mutation increases cancer risk at a younger age.

I don’t buy it because as we know, telomere length in dividing cell types decreases with age. However, lengthening telomeres with TERT is not associated with increased cancer as was originally feared. To the contrary, it protects cells from the damage incurred when the telomeres shorten and can even prevent cancer in this way. 

I digress. In summary, we both think that aging is primarily programmed. However I don’t think it was selected for by evolution, but rather a change that prevents aging has not occurred yet in humans. If aging were to be eliminated, so long as it does not have consequences, those with this trait would not be selected against, and the trait should persist in the population.",1,1599815409,longevity

It does in mice and rats.  In primates we don't really know beyond it appearing to impact some biomarkers.   From a treating aging perspective, it's not a particularly useful tool due to the fact that so few people willingly restrict their food intake already, and that it does not really save already aged people.

,nikkwong,"An early eating window is preferable for longevity. Glucose, insulin and other metabolic markers are much improved by early vs late feeding; which have direct impacts on homeostasis and aging. This has the nice side effect of weight control, but the weight control is attributable to the improved metabolic condition, not in and of itself alone as the the primary target. Weight control is measured because it's often the health target that is relevant for most metabolically compromised individuals, and it is easier to observe short term changes that are clinically significant and extrapolatable.

I'm also thin, and much prefer eating late to early; but, the science has spoken, and I've adjusted to it over time. I don't think you have to dig very deep to find the data I'm reciting, just try some queries like ""circadian rhythm feeding site:nih.gov""",1,1599700854,longevity
,StoicOptom,"&gt; Abstract

&gt; Mitigating effects of aging on human health remains elusive because aging impacts multiple systems simultaneously, and because experimental animals exhibit critical aging differences relative to humans. Separation of aging into discrete processes may identify targetable drivers of pathology, particularly when applied to human-specific features. Gradual homeostatic expansion of CD8 T cells dominantly alters their function in aging humans but not in mice. Injecting T cells into athymic mice induces rapid homeostatic expansion, but its relevance to aging remains uncertain. We hypothesized that homeostatic expansion of T cells injected into T-deficient hosts models physiologically relevant CD8 T cell aging in young mice, and aimed to analyze age-related T cell phenotype and tissue pathology in such animals. Indeed, we found that such injection conferred uniform age-related phenotype, genotype, and function to mouse CD8 T cells, heightened age-associated tissue pathology in young athymic hosts, and humanized amyloidosis after brain injury in secondary wild-type recipients. This validates a model conferring a human-specific aging feature to mice that identifies targetable drivers of tissue pathology. Similar examination of independent aging features should promote systematic understanding of aging and identify additional targets to mitigate its effects on human health.

Really cool and important study - my attempt at a simpler summary:

They 'transplanted' aged immune T cells into young nude mice (a type of mice with a genetic mutation that makes them develop no thymus, which makes them have no adaptive immune system and somehow also hairless), and showed that the young mice develop age-related diseases. 

They then did the same procedure to normal mice and found amyloid buildup after brain injury that is similar to what happens in human Alzheimer's. This research may therefore have implications on developing better animal models of age-related diseases and provide insights into the aging process and how to mitigate its profound pathological effects.",1,1599646992,longevity

&gt; Sarcopenia is the age‐related decline in muscle mass and function without any underlying disease. The exact molecular mechanisms responsible for this pathology remain unknown. 

&gt; The use of model organisms, such as mice, rats, flies, and worms, has advanced the field of sarcopenia research by identifying therapeutic strategies and genetic mutations that result in improved muscle mass and function of elderly animals. This review discusses molecular and therapeutic discoveries made using these model organisms and how these animals can be further utilized to better understand sarcopenia pathogenesis. 

&gt; In rodents, flies, and worms, dietary restriction improves muscle performance in old animals. In rodents and worms, exercise and a number of naturally occurring compounds alleviate sarcopenia. Reduction in the insulin/IGF1 receptor pathway, well known to promote longevity, improves sarcopenia in worms and flies. 

&gt; Mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia: In rodents, there is age‐dependent reduction in mitochondrial mass and a change in morphology; in nematodes, there is age‐dependent fragmentation of mitochondria that precedes sarcomeric disorganization. In Drosophila and rats, components of the 26S proteasome are elevated in aged muscle. An advantage of the worm and fly models is that these organisms lack muscle stem cells, and thus processes that promote the maintenance of already assembled muscle, can be identified without the confounding influence of muscle regeneration. Zebrafish are an up and coming model of sarcopenia for future consideration.

NAD+ can be raised in response to exercise, so another question is are you exercising regularly?   There are multiple benefits for aging, so long as you don't injure yourself or do something excessive like marathons or triathlons.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; The familial resemblance in length of adult life is very modest. Studies of parent‐offspring and twins suggest that exceptional health and survival have a stronger genetic component than lifespan generally. 

&gt; To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we collected information on Danish long‐lived siblings (born 1886–1938) from 659 families, their 5379 offspring (born 1917–1982), and 10,398 grandchildren (born 1950–2010) and matched background population controls through the Danish 1916 Census, the Civil Registration System, the National Patient Register, and the Register of Causes of Death. Comparison with the background, population revealed consistently lower occurrence of almost all disease groups and causes of death in the offspring and the grandchildren. 

&gt; The expected incidence of hospitalization for mental and behavioral disorders was reduced by half in the offspring (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.62) and by one‐third in the grandchildren (0.69, 0.61–0.78), while the numbers for tobacco‐related cancer were 0.60 (0.51–0.70) and 0.71 (0.48–1.05), respectively. Within‐family analyses showed a general, as opposed to specific, lowering of disease risk. 

&gt; Early parenthood and divorce were markedly less frequent in the longevity‐enriched families, while economic and educational differences were small to moderate. The longevity‐enriched families in this study have a general health advantage spanning three generations.

The average eunuch might even be stronger at 90 than the average steroid user, assuming any of the steroid users make it that far. 

I hope you can see an analogy with IGF-1. It might give you short term benefits at the expense of longevity and health later in life. The best way to increase longevity is to slow down the body's metabolic rate. Caloric restriction is the most effective way to do this. Taking IFG-1 or testosterone does the exact opposite of this, thereby accelerating aging.

Another way to think about this is in terms of primary and secondary aging. Primary aging refers to aging at the cellar level, while secondary aging refers to the effects of aging, like frailty and skin deterioration. It is a mistake to think that improving secondary aging will improve primary aging (e.g., taking testosterone to improve frailty or IGF-1 to improve skin).

,Idontknow1234568,"&gt;Epigenetic clocks to measure age emerged from the ability to cost-effectively obtain the moment to moment epigenome of an individual, the distribution of epigenetic marks on nuclear DNA that control gene expression. Cells react to their environment, and some of those reactions are characteristic of the ways in which the cellular environment changes with age. Given this data and ample computational power, it is possible to find weighted combinations of, for example, DNA methylation status at specific CpG sites that fairly accurately correlate with age. More interestingly, this appears to be a measure of biological age rather than chronological age, in that people with a higher epigenetic age than chronological age tend to have a higher incidence and later risk of age-related disease and dysfunction - and vice versa.  
&gt;  
&gt;It remains unclear is what exactly it is that is being measured by an epigenetic clock. Which processes of aging, the accumulation of damage and downstream change, actually cause these characteristic epigenetic changes across all individuals? Is it all of them? Or only some of them? Researchers have produced clocks based on patterns of transcription and protein levels in addition to epigenetic marks, and some of these later clocks use only a handful of transcripts, proteins, or marks. It seems unlikely that the more abbreviated clocks measure more than a fraction of the causative processes of aging. Since these processes interact, and all of the facets of aging proceed at much the same pace in most people, then a clock that measures, say, only chronic inflammation, might be just as good today as a clock that is affected by all mechanisms of aging.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is true, at least, until we start being able to repair specific forms of underlying cell and tissue damage, such as the presence of senescent cells. Some clocks will stop working usefully, and we don't really know which ones are vulnerable to the deployment of any given approach to rejuvenation. Which is a challenge, because assessing the results of therapies that repair specific forms of underlying cell and tissue damage is exactly how we'd like to use these clocks. As things stand, no clock, epigenetic or otherwise, can be trusted for such a task until it is fairly well calibrated against a class of rejuvenation therapy via multiple life span studies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Epigenetic measures of ageing predict the prevalence and incidence of leading causes of death and disease burden  
&gt;  
&gt;Individuals of the same chronological age display different rates of biological ageing. A number of measures of biological age have been proposed which harness age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles. These measures include five 'epigenetic clocks' which provide an index of how much an individual's biological age differs from their chronological age at the time of measurement. The five clocks encompass methylation-based predictors of chronological age (HorvathAge, HannumAge), all-cause mortality (DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge) and telomere length (DNAm Telomere Length). A sixth epigenetic measure of ageing differs from these clocks in that it acts as a speedometer providing a single time-point measurement of the pace of an individual's biological ageing. This measure of ageing is termed DunedinPoAm.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this study, we examined associations between six major epigenetic measures of ageing and the prevalence and incidence of the leading causes of mortality and disease burden in high-income countries. DNAm GrimAge, a predictor of mortality, associated with the prevalence of COPD and incidence of various disease states, including COPD, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It was associated with death due to all-cause mortality and outperformed competitor epigenetic measures of ageing in capturing variability across clinically associated continuous traits. Higher values for DunedinPoAm, which captures faster rates of biological ageing, associated with the incidence of COPD and lung cancer. Higher-than-expected DNAm PhenoAge predicted the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the present study. Age-adjusted measures of DNAm Telomere Length associated with the incidence of ischemic heart disease. Our results replicate previous cross-sectional findings between DNAm PhenoAge and body mass index, diabetes, and socioeconomic position (in a basic model). We also replicated associations between DNAm GrimAge and heart disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, using a large cohort with rich health and DNA methylation data, we provide the first comparison of six major epigenetic measures of biological ageing with respect to their associations with leading causes of mortality and disease burden. DNAm GrimAge outperformed the other measures in its associations with disease data and associated clinical traits. This may suggest that predicting mortality, rather than age or homeostatic characteristics, may be more informative for common disease prediction. Thus, proteomic-based methods (as utilised by DNAm GrimAge) using large, physiologically diverse protein sets for predicting ageing and health may be of particular interest in future studies. Our results may help to refine the future use and development of biological age estimators, particularly in studies which aim to comprehensively examine their ability to predict stringent clinically defined outcomes. Our analyses suggest that epigenetic measures of ageing can predict the incidence of common disease states, even after accounting for major confounding risk factors. This may have significant implications for their potential utility in clinical settings to complement gold-standard methods of clinical disease assessment and management.",1,1599258461,longevity

The new website consolidates important advances in scientific discovery that show how cellular health plays a key role in why and how we age.

&gt; Research from international experts in the field of aging and cellular function has shown that several of the key complaints of aging could be associated with changes in biological processes happening at the cellular level. The decline in these cellular mechanisms is being defined as AACD, a time-related deterioration in the way our cells function as we age, which often begins in our 40s and accelerates in our 60s.  AACD encompasses declines in mitochondrial health that can impact cell and organ function over time.

&gt; ""The quest to understand and combat aging is certainly not a new one, but this research gives us new insights into the natural aging process,"" said Greg Behar, CEO of Nestlé Health Science. ""Nestlé Health Science is committed to supporting scientific research that enhances our ability to help consumers live healthier lives. To support future innovation in the field of aging, MYAACD.org is a new resource that features a compilation of robust evidence around cellular decline.

I've been there for several deaths already, including a sibling, my father, 3/4 grandparents, a friend.. What I've experienced from those losses has kind of divided my view on death.  
Some of those loved ones were ready and almost waiting for death, while others were taken far too early and part of the sorrow I feel is due to all the experiences they didn't get to experience.  
So for me longevity is less about seeking immortality or a specific number. It's about improving my odds of getting to experience all that I want to experience in good health, and when I'm ready to go, I'll be content with it and hope that my loved ones see that as well. There's the hurt you cause the people who love you as well, and if there's a way to lessen to odds of causing that grief, good. If I'm the last to go, I will have succeeded.  


The older people (my grandparents) I had discussions with, were ready to go. They had seen a lot of the people they grew up with and were friends with die. Yes, they had a lot of children and grandchildren, and new were popping up. But it's not the same, is it? You don't have the people around you who have shared where you came from and who you were younger. It's different to tell about your experiences to new people who are yet to experience it all on their own. You know so much and have so much experience, yet you know that people will need to learn those things on their own. You can depart wisdom on to younger ears, but they'll understand it only through their own experience. So you need people around you who are your link to your past. So at least for my grandparents, it seems that all of them were content to go mainly out of two reasons: the people with shared past were going, and the other one was the cumulated sorrow they'd experienced themselves. How many funerals can you go to before going numb and wanting to leave that behind?  


As for the younger people taken: 1/3 did it by their own hand, and I don't blame them. Their whole life was a life riddled with depression and no medicine or therapy helped. Every waking day was torture. We don't experience another person's feelings or strife, so all we can do is accept that that was the right decision for them. 

The issue I have with are the remaining 2. They were taken too early by sickness that could've been avoidable. They had the will to live and all the loving people were still around them. Their last years on earth were far from optimal. Spending time in hospitals, being unable to do the activities they loved, seeing the pain their loved ones feel and knowing that their end is coming, but unsure whether it happens in a month, a year, two years.. They wanted to see and do so much more, but that option was taken from them.  


So most importantly for me focusing on longevity is increasing my chances of deciding when I am ready to go, and being able to experience all that I want to the fullest. So it's not about a certain age, it's about being healthy until I don't feel like being that anymore. And hoping I don't cause sorrow to my loved ones, but rather have them understand and accept when I'm gone.",1,1599111711,longevity

&gt; BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a growing pandemic with an increasing death toll that has been linked to various comorbidities as well as racial disparity. However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95%CI 2.19-3.10; p&lt;0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.64-2.28; p&lt;0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95%CI 2.07-2.93; p&lt;0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.78-2.48; p&lt;0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95%CI 2.11-6.2; p&lt;0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.

The issue right now for senolytics that senescent cell targeting is still in pre-clinical stages in terms of identifying which sub-populations of senescent cells are beneficial to remove, which organs can be targeted by different drugs, and potential toxicity/side-effects.    At the same time, Unity and Mayo clinic have gone ahead with administering senolytics to humans to establish safety.

I think the good news for rapamycin is that many are optimistic about lack of side effects at low/intermittent dosing compared to the larger doses used for immunosuppression in organ transplants. 

Even though some US doctors are prescribing it off-label and it has been hyped by Peter Attia.   We do need human data around these lower doses in actual studies to start building out a picture of what the effects and benefits are.

This is great news for example (and I've heard AdG say he applauds anyone working on aging interventions, even if there is philosophical disagreement, because it's been such a difficult thing to get traction on):

I think AdG views CR as interesting, but it's only slowing the accumulation of age related changes.    He covers the limited potential of ""tinkering with metabolism"" in his introductory talks.   

There is also some drosophilia research out of the Buck institute that shows that there might be different responses (negative) to CR depending on genetic background.   

CR is also difficult for most people to practice.  Look at the existing percentage of people who are overweight/obese.   Not to mention that for people who are already doing very slight CR (those who just eat modestly) may only receive marginal benefit.   That would be quite disappointing if people were only working on getting people to practice CR.

I think it's worth mentioning that exercise recruits all sorts of beneficial responses to maintaining healthspan... but saying CR is all there is, would be like saying exercise is all there is to health.   There has to be underlying biology that can be ""got at"" to tackle the root of age related disease.    

Not to diminish CR research...  Of course it's valuable, it's unravelling parts of aging biology.   But, why not take multiple approaches?


The SENS approach (which many even outside of SENS are interested in... Unity, Oisin, Buck, David Sinclair's senolytx, and others)  is partly about clearing accumulated damage (glucosepane crosslinks, senescent cells).   https://www.fightaging.org/faq#what-is-sens - this is where AdG and others think there is potential to get bigger gains than CR (which would make CR look trivial) if the therapies were simple, effective, and could be done at scale.

For example, such trials could be based on the observations that senolytics reduce adverse consequences of bleomycin‐induced pulmonary injury19 and radiation‐induced injury in mice.22

Abstract:

&gt; Increased healthcare and pharmaceutical understanding has led to the eradication of many childhood, infectious and preventable diseases; however, we are now experiencing the impact of aging disorders as the lifespan increases. These disorders have already become a major burden on society and threaten to become a defining challenge of our generation. Indications such as Alzheimer’s disease gain headlines and have focused the thinking of many towards dementia and cognitive decline in aging.  

&gt; Indications related to neurological function and related behaviors are thus an extremely important starting point in the consideration of therapeutics.However, the reality is that pathological aging covers a spectrum of significant neurological and peripheral indications. Development of therapeutics to treat aging and age-related disorders is therefore a huge need, but represents a largely unexplored path.

&gt; Fundamental scientific questions need to be considered as we embark towards a goal of improving health in old age, including how we:  

&gt; 1) define aging as a therapeutic target

&gt; 2) model aging preclinically and 

&gt; 3) effectively translate from preclinical models to man. 

&gt; Furthermore, the challenges associated with identifying novel therapeutics in a financial, regulatory and clinical sense need to be contemplated carefully to ensure we address the unmet need in our increasingly elderly population. The complexity of the challenge requires different perspectives, cross-functional partnerships and diverse concepts. We seek to raise issues to guide the field, considering the current state of thinking to aid in identifying roadblocks and important challenges early. 

&gt; The need for therapeutics that address aging and age-related disorders is acute, but the promise of effective treatments provides huge opportunities that, as a community, we all seek to enable effectively as soon as possible.",1,1598561645,longevity

&gt; Decoding SARS-CoV-2 hijacking of host mitochondria in COVID-19 pathogenesis

Abstract:

&gt; Because of the ongoing pandemic around the world, the mechanisms underlying the SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 are subject to intense investigation. Based on available data for the SARS-CoV-1 virus, we suggest how CoV-2 localization of RNA transcripts in mitochondria hijacks the host cell’s mitochondrial function to viral advantage. Besides viral RNA transcripts, RNA also localizes to mitochondria. SARS-CoV-2 may manipulate mitochondrial function indirectly, first by ACE2 regulation of mitochondrial function, and once it enters the host cell, open-reading frames (ORFs) such as ORF-9b can directly manipulate mitochondrial function to evade host cell immunity and facilitate virus replication and COVID-19 disease. Manipulations of host mitochondria by viral ORFs can release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytoplasm and activate mtDNA-induced inflammasome and suppress innate and adaptive immunity. We argue that a decline in ACE2 function in aged individuals, coupled with the age-associated decline in mitochondrial functions resulting in chronic metabolic disorders like diabetes or cancer, may make the host more vulnerable to infection and health complications to mortality. These observations suggest that distinct localization of viral RNA and proteins in mitochondria must play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying virus communication with host mitochondria may provide critical insights into COVID-19 pathologies. An investigation into the SARS-CoV-2 hijacking of mitochondria should lead to novel approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19.",1,1598561398,longevity

Results show that changes in life expectancy during 1970‐2014 were associated with changes in state policies on a conservative‐liberal continuum, where more liberal policies expand economic regulations and protect marginalized groups. States that implemented more conservative policies were more likely to experience a reduction in life expectancy. We estimated that the shallow upward trend in US life expectancy from 2010 to 2014 would have been 25% steeper for women and 13% steeper for men had state policies not changed as they did. We also estimated that US life expectancy would be 2.8 years longer among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all states enjoyed the health advantages of states with more liberal policies.

Conclusions

Understanding and reversing the troubling trends and growing inequalities in US life expectancy requires attention to US state policy contexts, their dynamic changes in recent decades, and the forces behind those changes. Changes in US political and policy contexts since the 1970s may undergird the deterioration of Americans’ health and longevity.",1,1598549114,longevity

Increased healthcare and pharmaceutical understanding has led to the eradication of many childhood, infectious and preventable diseases; however, we are now experiencing the impact of aging disorders as the lifespan increases. These disorders have already become a major burden on society and threaten to become a defining challenge of our generation. Indications such as Alzheimer’s disease gain headlines and have focused the thinking of many towards dementia and cognitive decline in aging. Indications related to neurological function and related behaviors are thus an extremely important starting point in the consideration of therapeutics.However, the reality is that pathological aging covers a spectrum of significant neurological and peripheral indications. Development of therapeutics to treat aging and age-related disorders is therefore a huge need, but represents a largely unexplored path.


Fundamental scientific questions need to be considered as we embark towards a goal of improving health in old age, including how we 1) define aging as a therapeutic target, 2) model aging preclinically and 3) effectively translate from preclinical models to man. Furthermore, the challenges associated with identifying novel therapeutics in a financial, regulatory and clinical sense need to be contemplated carefully to ensure we address the unmet need in our increasingly elderly population. The complexity of the challenge requires different perspectives, cross-functional partnerships and diverse concepts. We seek to raise issues to guide the field, considering the current state of thinking to aid in identifying roadblocks and important challenges early.

,HuricaneFighterPlane,"&gt;It was found that serum levels of indirect bilirubin and PUFAs as well as albumin were higher in the centenarians with better performance status. 


&gt;Indirect bilirubin, serum levels of which are mildly elevated in Gilbert syndrome (a common genetic variant), is thought to have antioxidant effects by acting as a direct oxidant scavenger and by inhibiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)oxidase activity. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that Gilbert syndrome has some health benefits to reduce
risk of age-related diseases. Interestingly, a recent study reported that low serum bilirubin level is a strong predictive bio-marker for disability in activities in daily living in Japanese elderly patients with diabetes. Similarly, the present study indicated that serum indirect bilirubin level was associated with the degree of physical activity in Japanese centenarians.


&gt;Bilirubin, a final decomposition product of heme metabolim, is
bound to albumin in order to be transported in the blood circulation. Albumin-bound bilirubin was demonstrated to protect albumin-bound linoleic acid from peroxyl radical-induced oxidation. Indirect bilirubin and free fatty acids are bound to albumin in the blood. In the present study, serum indirect bilirubin was found
to significantly correlate with serum dihomo-γ-linolenic acid,
arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, in addition to serum albumin. This may suggest that albumin-bound bilirubin protects PUFAs from peroxidation while not competing for albumin binding,although dietary factors, not studied, should be taken into account.
Arachidonic acid, despite the precursor of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, also has potential health benefits
. On the contrary,a higher content of PUFAs susceptible to peroxidation in the blood or membrane bilayers is postulated to be unfavorable for longevity. From the present results, it is inferred that centenarians with better performance status have a higher content of PUFAs protected from peroxidation.

A good lifestyle helps increase the percentage of the healthy part of a life span, as well as reduces risk of early death or chronic sickness or disability, but does not help in defeating the inevitable age related disease.

In particular among these, you might be interested in checking out the FMD (/r/FMD).   It's a 5 day intervention designed by a biogerontologist named Valter Longo.  He details the history of his research and work on longevity, and the rationale for the 5 day diet in his book ""the longevity diet"".

Though, it may not be recommended at a very advanced age, especially if on medication.  Really recommend reviewing the book first, and then otherwise just looking at improving diet (/r/ScientificNutrition / cronometer.com) to make sure that there are no deficiencies, regular exercise, blood pressure is under control, etc.

Abstract:

&gt; There is an increased focus on treatments to extend the healthspan. There is solid evidence that exercise extends the healthspan, but other treatments, such as metformin and statins, are also gaining traction. If metformin and statins will be used to prolong healthspan, we must understand their effects in those free of disease and in combination with exercise.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **What Do We Not Know and
Recommendations for Moving
Forward**

&gt; It is widely recognized that we do not yet know the
exact mechanisms of action of metformin, although
we do understand some downstream consequences.
This lack of knowledge about mechanisms was acceptable because metformin had clear benefits for its
primary indication of treatment of T2D. However,
as the potential indications for metformin expand,
it becomes increasingly important to understand
its mechanisms to understand when it may or may
not be effective as preventative medicine. In terms
of statins, the direct benefit on disease is well understood since it lowers circulating cholesterol
through inhibition of the hepatic enzyme HMGCoA reductase. However, questions do remain as
to how statins impose negative effects on skeletal
muscle mitochondrial function. Variations in
genes that encode proteins important for hepatocellular uptake or biodegradation may lead to
higher circulating levels of statins and thus greater
skeletal muscle exposure (5). At the level of the
skeletal muscle, statins do inhibit mitochondrial
respiration, and mixed findings suggest this too
may be due depletion of CoQ10, inhibition of complex 3 (80) of the electron transport chain via statin
lactones, and other factors that deserve further
study (5).

&gt; There are many other unanswered questions related to exercise and drug interactions (FIGURE 3).
For example, as identified earlier, it is largely unknown how exercise and metformin interact in those
who already have T2D. Although many studies have
identified the negative impact of metformin on exercise adaptations in healthy individuals, it is unknown
how they interact in diseased individuals. This unknown begs the question: Is there something about
the metabolic health, aerobic capacity, or skeletal
muscle mitochondrial function that impacts the
interaction of a medication and exercise, especially
a medication that is thought to have mitochondrial
effects? In addition, we do not know how the order
of initiation impacts outcomes. For example, if
someone is already a regular exerciser or is already
on metformin or a statin, does initiating the second treatment impact the outcome? Furthermore,
does dosing impact the interaction with exercise?
In other words, could using metformin or statins at
a subclinical dose for preventative purposes lessen
the potential negative interactions with exercise?  

&gt; Answering these questions requires additional
studies examining basic mechanisms, as well as
clinical trials. In addition, the all too common critique that “we already know that exercise works, so
why study it?” has to be reframed and contextualized. We need to clearly understand mechanisms
by which both exercise and certain classes of medication evoke positive outcomes if we are to effectively utilize them together to extend healthspan
and maximize benefit. For this latter point, the NIH
Common Fund Molecular Transducers of Physical
Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) trial designed to
study the molecular map that underlies the benefits of physical activity should be particularly useful. 

&gt; Finally, we need to remember the principle of
do no harm since, in some cases, there has been
unexpected detrimental outcomes with drug and
exercise interactions. In conclusion, millions of
Americans will be prescribed metformin and/or
statins while also being recommended regular
daily exercise to extend healthspan. A great deal of
work needs to be performed to understand these
interactions and the impact on long-term health
and disease.",1,1597743681,longevity

,BlinkOnce_DarkStar,"&gt;What do you mean there isn't any point in creating a streaming service? Wouldn't providing movies to all citizens in an easily accessible format be better for society than relying on distribution of tapes, which required menial labor to move from place to place?

No, because there is a cost associated with doing so.  Once again I'm speaking in hyperbole, so let's adjust it to satisfy a less generalized and more specific point because I'm wrong in stating there is ""no"" point.  

There could be a motivation for creating a streaming service such as ""I think it would be better if we had this instead of what we currently have because it would be better for people.""  That motivation will possibly, eventually be carried out by someone.  It will be significantly slower than the motivation that is ""this will benefit people **AND** make a better life for me and my family.""

In addition, this is assuming you can already see the path to progress, which isn't the case.  Not only does someone have to actually do it, but you have to actually think of it first.  Capitalism encourages people to search out the greatest problems or needs in society and find solutions for them.  In our example, you could argue there isn't a problem.  There are slight inconveniences, but not enough to say, ""alright, let's create an entire new medium for this content in order to distribute it.""

We've already seen the difference in success between non-capitalist motivation and capitalist motivation, and the difference is vast.  The number of people that will selflessly work incredibly hard to think of and then execute ideas is drastically lower than the number of people that will do it for gain, hence why capitalism has produced significantly more progress.

You can go down the line to exacerbate the issues that removing capitalism would create.  For example, it is important to remember that individuals don't always make progress, sometimes it is a group effort.  In a capitalist society, you can incentivize each person with capital to work on a project, without it those types of projects require all parties involved to do things out self-motivation.  So, even if you have a great idea, it's possible you as an individual simply wouldn't be able to turn that idea into anything even if you had the motivation to do it.

&gt;Yes, and streaming services are now largely worthless because content is split among 20 different services thanks to IP ownership. Under a theoretical nationalized streaming service, ALL movies could be streamed from one website, piracy wouldn't need to exist, and artists of all talent levels wouldn't need to be starving artists.

Right, so people can pay for the content they actually want and those services are competing against one another for customers, meaning they have to provide better content than their competitors in order to maintain existence.  Streaming services are not worthless at all, what an asinine statement.  Why do hundreds of millions of people subscribe to a worthless service?

Under a nationalized streaming service, it makes no difference if everything they show is total garbage because there is no penalty for producing garbage.  Artists of all talent levels shouldn't be equally represented, and artists of all talent levels would also drastically reduce the rate at which they make content because the cost in both effort, money, and time far outweigh the 0 material benefits.  The only benefit would be each individual's pride in the creation of the project.

This actually is another great example.  Sure, maybe the big time actors and directors would be happy to have the fame, glory, and pride that goes into making a major movie still.  Why would the cameraguy, light guy, editors, etc. etc. that get 0 benefit of that other than the ""pride"" aspect ever agree to go do that work?  There are hundreds of people behind the scenes that go into making major films, if even a small percentage of them decide that they'd rather just not, that will have a cascading effect on the entire industry, and quite frankly it would be far more than a small percentage.  If not incentivized or compelled, people that do work that has little acclaim will eventually just stop doing that work.

Unless of course you're planning on using the government to force people to work against their will.

&gt;The market cannot and will not solve societal problems on their own without a profit, and spoilers, longevity is one of those things. Imagine if more resources had been poured into longevity decades ago, along with fusion? Things may be very different.

The average person doesn't find those things to be valuable, so you're right, capitalism itself does not target societal issues unless the society as a whole recognizes those issues.  This very reddit post illustrates that some people don't even think we should pursue longevity, let alone that it is an important issue.  Some people don't think renewable energy or clean energy are all that important either.

I've already acknowledged that in some sectors, privatization may fail us.  You could argue that health care should be available to everyone.  You may argue that considering climate change, renewable energy should be worked toward by the government even without the private sector seeing it as beneficial.  You could use specific examples where government intervention is necessary, as I've already advocated for a hybrid system, I am not stating cases don't exist where the government needs to intervene and push society in a proper direction.

&gt;This is not corruption, this is how capitalism is fundamentally. Corporate lawyers' primary purpose is to skirt all laws. The more regulations you put down, the more money is poured into routing around laws.

That is indeed corruption.  What is the purpose of tax law being so complicated?  If you had an incredibly simple tax law, for example, a 20% flat tax, there are no loopholes.  You pay 20% in taxes.  You shouldn't need an accountant or lawyer to do taxes, the fact that tax law can be complicated enough that loop holes are available is corruption in itself.

If we want to get into the semantics of capitalism, it's basically a waste of time.  Let's just say you're right and two owners agreeing to both not lower prices is fundamental to capitalism and not corruption, it doesn't matter, you still take the better system and try to iron out its inherent flaws that even while existing still produce results magnitudes better than the system that doesn't.

Do you have an example of a society with virtually no capitalist elements that has had a rise similar to the United States in relevance, technological development, and economic growth?  Its such a strange idea that the system that produced the most powerful, most wealthy nation on the planet has no merit.  [China runs its markets with capitalist principles](https://www.inkstonenews.com/china-translated/china-translated-china-socialist/article/2161467), the government just controls the wealth when it wants to.  We can go down the list of the wealthiest nations, they're all or nearly all going to be mostly capitalist markets with varying degrees of social ""welfare"", and that's because nations that develop do so from incentivizing their population to innovate.",1,1597286544,longevity

&gt; We hypothesised that hypoxic-hypercapnic environment (HHE) could induce metabolic suppression and associated benefits for health and longevity, as observed in the naked-mole rat (NMR). We developed a model of self-produced HHE (similar to a natural habitat of NMRs), which is simple, reliable and natural, and does not require external sources of gases or complex technical equipment. Here, we showed for the first time that a chronic exposure of mice to HHE could be a unique tool for NMR-like metabolic remodeling, resulting in a long-term and substantial decrease in metabolic rate, body temperature, and food consumption, without significant changes in expression of stress-related genes. Unexpectedly, the HHE accelerated skin wound healing, despite the lower energy expenditure. The self-produced HHE could be considered a model of voluntary calorie restriction. All in all, a chronic exposure to HHE offers a potential of being a lifespan-extending intervention as well as an efficient tool for treating the overweight and associated metabolic disorders.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Significance:

&gt; Aging is a degradative process that varies among individuals. Due to limitations in defining and differentiating aging rates in human populations, understanding why some people appear to age slower than others has proven difficult. 

&gt; We analyzed 44 blood-based indices of health as candidate aging rate biomarkers collected over a 25-y period on a relevant, long-lived population of dolphins. Evidence of subsets of dolphins exhibiting slow and accelerated aging rates were detected, despite sharing the same environment, diet, and health care.   

&gt; Furthermore, some dolphin subsets were more likely to develop clinically relevant conditions, including anemia and immunosenescence. Our results support the notion that aging rates in long-lived mammals may be defined and provide insight into novel interventions to delay aging.

Abstract:

&gt; While it is believed that humans age at different rates, a lack of robust longitudinal human studies using consensus biomarkers meant to capture aging rates has hindered an understanding of the degree to which individuals vary in their rates of aging. Because bottlenose dolphins are long-lived mammals that develop comorbidities of aging similar to humans, we analyzed data from a well-controlled, 25-y longitudinal cohort of 144 US Navy dolphins housed in the same oceanic environment. 

&gt; Our analysis focused on 44 clinically relevant hematologic and clinical chemistry measures recorded during routine blood draws throughout the dolphins’ lifetimes. Using stepwise regression and general linear models that accommodate correlations between measures obtained on individual dolphins, we demonstrate that, in a manner similar to humans, dolphins exhibit independent and linear age-related declines in four of these measures: hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, platelets, and lymphocytes. Using linear regressions and analyses of covariance with post hoc Tukey–Kramer tests to compare slopes (i.e., linear age-related rates) of our four aging rate biomarkers among 34 individual dolphins aging from 10 y to up to 40 y old, we could identify slow and accelerated agers and differentiate subgroups that were more or less likely to develop anemia and lymphopenia. 

&gt; This study successfully documents aging rate differences over the lifetime of long-lived individuals in a controlled environment. Our study suggests that nonenvironmental factors influencing aging rate biomarkers, including declining hemoglobin and anemia, may be targeted to delay the effects of aging in a compelling model of human biology.",2,1597197622,longevity

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; The effects of two different mitochondrial‐targeted drugs, SS‐31 and NMN, were tested on Old mouse hearts. After treatment with the drugs, individually or Combined, heart function was examined by echocardiography. SS‐31 partially reversed an age‐related decline in diastolic function while NMN fully reversed an age‐related deficiency in systolic function at a higher workload. 

&gt; Metabolomic analysis revealed that both NMN and the Combined treatment increased nicotinamide and 1‐methylnicotinamide levels, indicating greater NAD+ turnover, but only the Combined treatment resulted in significantly greater steady‐state NAD(H) levels. A novel magnetic resonance spectroscopy approach was used to assess how metabolite levels responded to changing cardiac workload. PCr/ATP decreased in response to increased workload in Old Control, but not Young, hearts, indicating an age‐related decline in energetic capacity. Both drugs were able to normalize the PCr/ATP dynamics. SS‐31 and NMN treatment also increased mitochondrial NAD(P)H production under the higher workload, while only NMN increased NAD+ in response to increased work. These measures did not shift in hearts given the Combined treatment, which may be owed to the enhanced NAD(H) levels in the resting state after this treatment. 

&gt; Overall, these results indicate that both drugs are effective at restoring different aspects of mitochondrial and heart health and that combining them results in a synergistic effect that rejuvenates Old hearts and best recapitulates the Young state.",1,1597147798,longevity

To answer the question you asked:  Niagen by Chromadex is the current mass supplier and licenser of the patent (giving them the right to produce/sell).  

The other player is Elysium Health, who sell a combination product of NR and pterostilbene (an even less well proven supplement, that may increase LDL cholesterol, still largely considered to be bad).

If going for the cheap option (Niacin), just go with a well known brand that does lab testing like NOW Foods.

health decline that is so universal, gradual and predictable in terms of when it happens that it
feels inevitable (what we call “aging”) is different than the health decline that happens to some
people but not to others (what we call “disease”). Thus far our efforts have focused on treating
“disease” only. We seem to accept the yearly death toll from influenza, which kills tens of thousands
of mostly elderly people, because immunosenescence prevents vaccines from working. Similarly,
even though the media is highly publicizing young COVID-19 cases, the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths are old people exhibiting immunosenescence. On a biological level there is often no clear
distinction in the decline; the aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a
chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) in addition to acquired immune system
impairment (immune senescence).",1,1596797247,longevity

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; **Background**  

 &gt;Individuals of the same chronological age display different rates of biological ageing. A number of measures of biological age have been proposed which harness age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles. These measures include five ‘epigenetic clocks’ which provide an index of how much an individual’s biological age differs from their chronological age at the time of measurement.  

&gt; The five clocks encompass methylation-based predictors of chronological age (HorvathAge, HannumAge), all-cause mortality (DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge) and telomere length (DNAm Telomere Length). A sixth epigenetic measure of ageing differs from these clocks in that it acts as a speedometer providing a single time-point measurement of the pace of an individual’s biological ageing. This measure of ageing is termed DunedinPoAm. In this study, we test the association between these six epigenetic measures of ageing and the prevalence and incidence of the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in high-income countries (n ≤ 9537, Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study).

&gt; **Results**

&gt; DNAm GrimAge predicted incidence of clinically diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease after 13 years of follow-up (hazard ratios = 2.22, 1.52 and 1.41, respectively). DunedinPoAm predicted the incidence of COPD and lung cancer (hazard ratios = 2.02 and 1.45, respectively). DNAm PhenoAge predicted incidence of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.54). DNAm Telomere Length associated with the incidence of ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio = 0.80). DNAm GrimAge associated with all-cause mortality, the prevalence of COPD and spirometry measures at the study baseline. These associations were present after adjusting for possible confounding risk factors including alcohol consumption, body mass index, deprivation, education and tobacco smoking and surpassed stringent Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds.

Such interspecies divergences affected multiple metabolic pathways involving amino, bile and fatty acids as well as monosaccharides and nucleotides. **The most intriguing metabolites were those that had previously been linked to pro-health and antiaging effects in mice and that were significantly increased in the long-lived rodent compared to its short-lived counterpart. This pattern applies to α-tocopherol (also known as vitamin E) and polyamines (in particular cadaverine, N8-acetylspermidine and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine), all of which were more abundant in naked mole-rats than in mice. Moreover, the age-associated decline in spermidine and N1-acetylspermidine levels observed in mice did not occur, or is even reversed (in the case of N1-acetylspermidine) in naked mole-rats.** In short, the present metabolomics analysis provides a series of testable hypotheses to explain the exceptional longevity of naked mole-rats.

,dreiter,"&gt;The number of older people, including those living with dementia, is rising, as younger age mortality declines. However, the age-specific incidence of dementia has fallen in many countries, probably because of improvements in education, nutrition, health care, and lifestyle changes. Overall, **a growing body of evidence supports the nine potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia modelled by the 2017 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care: less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, and low social contact. We now add three more risk factors for dementia with newer, convincing evidence. These factors are excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution. We have completed new reviews and meta-analyses and incorporated these into an updated 12 risk factor life-course model of dementia prevention. Together the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40% of worldwide dementias, which consequently could theoretically be prevented or delayed.** The potential for prevention is high and might be higher in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) where more dementias occur.

&gt;**Key messages**

&gt;- Three new modifiable risk factors for dementia

&gt;- New evidence supports adding three modifiable risk factors—excessive alcohol consumption, head injury, and air pollution—to our 2017 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care life-course model of nine factors (less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, and infrequent social contact).

&gt;- Modifying 12 risk factors might prevent or delay up to 40% of dementias.

&gt;- Be ambitious about prevention

&gt;- Prevention is about policy and individuals. Contributions to the risk and mitigation of dementia begin early and continue throughout life, so it is never too early or too late. These actions require both public health programmes and individually tailored interventions. In addition to population strategies, policy should address high-risk groups to increase social, cognitive, and physical activity; and vascular health.

&gt;- Specific actions for risk factors across the life course

&gt;- Aim to maintain systolic BP of 130 mm Hg or less in midlife from around age 40 years (antihypertensive treatment for hypertension is the only known effective preventive medication for dementia).

&gt;- Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss and reduce hearing loss by protection of ears from excessive noise exposure.

&gt;- Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke.

&gt;- Prevent head injury.

&gt;- Limit alcohol use, as alcohol misuse and drinking more than 21 units weekly increase the risk of dementia.

&gt;- Avoid smoking uptake and support smoking cessation to stop smoking, as this reduces the risk of dementia even in later life.

&gt;- Provide all children with primary and secondary education.

&gt;- Reduce obesity and the linked condition of diabetes. Sustain midlife, and possibly later life physical activity.

&gt;- Addressing other putative risk factors for dementia, like sleep, through lifestyle interventions, will improve general health.

&gt;- Tackle inequality and protect people with dementia

&gt;- Many risk factors cluster around inequalities, which occur particularly in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups and in vulnerable populations. Tackling these factors will involve not only health promotion but also societal action to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives. Examples include creating environments that have physical activity as a norm, reducing the population profile of blood pressure rising with age through better patterns of nutrition, and reducing potential excessive noise exposure.

&gt;- Dementia is rising more in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) than in high-income countries, because of population ageing and higher frequency of potentially modifiable risk factors. Preventative interventions might yield the largest dementia reductions in LMIC.

&gt;**For those with dementia, recommendations are:**

&gt;- Provide holistic post-diagnostic care

&gt;- Post-diagnostic care for people with dementia should address physical and mental health, social care, and support. Most people with dementia have other illnesses and might struggle to look after their health and this might result in potentially preventable hospitalisations.

&gt;- Manage neuropsychiatric symptoms

&gt;- Specific multicomponent interventions decrease neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia and are the treatments of choice. Psychotropic drugs are often ineffective and might have severe adverse effects.

&gt;- Care for family carers

&gt;- Specific interventions for family carers have long-lasting effects on depression and anxiety symptoms, increase quality of life, are cost-effective and might save money.

,chromosomalcrossover,"Abstract:

&gt; Paternal aging and the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring are well documented. Yet, the underlying mechanism and the mode of inheritance have not been conclusively established. Advancing paternal age is a subtle and varying phenotype. As such, it is likely that a threshold for cumulative risk may exist that, if surpassed, culminates in a predisposition to disease and ultimately an observed phenotype in offspring.  

&gt; Epigenetic regulation provides a plausible explanation for the nongenetic paternal transmission of disease susceptibility. With the use of whole‐genome methylation sequencing, the data described herein substantiate an increasingly compromised DNA methylation profile as sperm ages and, for the first time, also demonstrate a generational correlation in sperm and blastocyst of an altered methylome associated with advanced paternal age. Methylation alterations are not randomly distributed across the genome, but appear clustered at certain chromosomal locations, and significantly colocalize with regions of nucleosome retention. Genes associated with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are significantly enriched with causative methylation aberrations in both sperm and embryos from aged fathers. The long‐term health burden and societal economic impact of these conditions are substantial and will continue with increasingly prevalent diagnosis.

,StoicOptom,"&gt; Abstract

&gt; Periodontal disease is an age-associated disorder clinically defined by periodontal bone loss, inflammation of the specialized tissues that surround and support the tooth, and microbiome dysbiosis. Currently, there is no therapy for reversing periodontal disease, and treatment is generally restricted to preventive measures or tooth extraction. 

&gt; The FDA-approved drug rapamycin slows aging and extends lifespan in multiple organisms, including mice. Here, we demonstrate that short-term treatment with rapamycin rejuvenates the aged oral cavity of elderly mice, including regeneration of periodontal bone, attenuation of gingival and periodontal bone inflammation, and revertive shift of the oral microbiome toward a more youthful composition. 

&gt; This provides a geroscience strategy to potentially rejuvenate oral health and reverse periodontal disease in the elderly.

Wish we could actually run more clinical trials for this in humans. If I had to hazard a guess, other than the poor profitability for an off-patent drug, physician researchers are far too fixated on the adverse effects at high dose. Probably explains the lack of impetus despite overwhelming evidence of its efficacy with increasing healthspan + lifespan in phylogenetically diverse animal models.

&gt;Caloric restriction (CR) is a traditional but scientifically verified approach to promoting health and increasing lifespan. CR exerts its effects through multiple molecular pathways that trigger major metabolic adaptations. It influences key nutrient and energy-sensing pathways including mammalian target of rapamycin, Sirtuin 1, AMP-activated protein kinase, and insulin signaling, ultimately resulting in reductions in basic metabolic rate, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased autophagy and mitochondrial efficiency. CR shares multiple overlapping pathways with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), particularly in energy metabolism and inflammation. Consequently, several lines of evidence suggest that PPARs might be indispensable for beneficial outcomes related to CR. In this review, we present the available evidence for the interconnection between CR and PPARs, highlighting their shared pathways and analyzing their interaction.

Abstract

The aim of the present study was to determine if the training status decreases inflammation, slows down senescence and preserves telomeres health in skeletal muscle in older compared to younger subjects, with a specific focus on satellite cells. Analyses were conducted on skeletal muscle and cultured satellite cells from vastus lateralis biopsies (n=34) of male volunteers divided into four groups: young sedentary (YS), young trained cyclists (YT), old sedentary (OS) and old trained cyclists (OT). The senescence state and inflammatory profile were evaluated by telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIF) quantification, senescence associated b-gal (SA-b-Gal) staining and qRT-PCR. Independently of the endurance training status, TIF levels (+35%, P &lt; 0.001) and the percentage of SA-b-Gal positive cells (+30%, P &lt; 0.05) were higher in cultured satellite cells of older compared to younger subjects. p16 (4-5 fold) and p21 (2-fold) mRNA levels in skeletal muscle were higher with age but unchanged by the training status. Aging induced higher CD68 mRNA levels in human skeletal muscle (+102%, P = 0.009). Independently of age, both trained groups had lower IL-8 mRNA levels (-70%, P = 0.011) and tended to have lower TNFa mRNA levels (-40%, P = 0.10) compared with the sedentary subjects. *All together, we found that the endurance training status did not slow down senescence in skeletal muscle and satellite cells in older compared to younger subjects despite reduced inflammation in skeletal muscle. These findings highlight that the link between senescence and inflammation can be disrupted in skeletal muscle.*",1,1595476372,longevity

Abstract:

&gt; **Background**

&gt; DNA methylation (DNAm) age constitutes a powerful tool to assess the molecular age and overall health status of biological samples. Recently, it has been shown that tissue-specific DNAm age predictors may present superior performance compared to the pan- or multi-tissue counterparts. The skin is the largest organ in the body and bears important roles, such as body temperature control, barrier function, and protection from external insults. As a consequence of the constant and intimate interaction between the skin and the environment, current DNAm estimators, routinely trained using internal tissues which are influenced by other stimuli, are mostly inadequate to accurately predict skin DNAm age.

&gt; **Results**

&gt; In the present study, we developed a highly accurate skin-specific DNAm age predictor, using DNAm data obtained from 508 human skin samples. Based on the analysis of 2,266 CpG sites, we accurately calculated the DNAm age of cultured skin cells and human skin biopsies. Age estimation was sensitive to the biological age of the donor, cell passage, skin disease status, as well as treatment with senotherapeutic drugs.

&gt; **Conclusions**

&gt; This highly accurate skin-specific DNAm age predictor constitutes a holistic tool that will be of great use in the analysis of human skin health status/molecular aging, as well as in the analysis of the potential of established and novel compounds to alter DNAm age.

As you get older you save and ideally you should save more and more until you retire, then you can have a lot of fun and not worry. Exercise, diet/lifestyle are like savings. The problem is that most people do less, not more, as they age. But, I decided years ago to do just the opposite. I started exercising in mid-age, running (with zero drop minimal shoes to also train my feet out of years of cushioned shoe wearing) and every year my diet gets better, not worse. I also work on emotional health, being careful to not suppress what I feel, to always let whatever it is out. I think this is a silent killer and ages you greatly, the continual learned suppression (and eventual repression which is unconscious suppression) of your emotions and we must always remember that emotions are physical, they are chemical.

So, as you age save more, and save more biologically too. The hard truth is that if you want the best odds you have to do at lest 30 minutes of intense exercise, aerobic exercise, almost every day and you have to basically be a vegan the vast majority of the time and eat decent quality food.

Abstract:

&gt; Commonly used measures of population aging categorize adults into those who are “old” and those who are not. How this threshold of the stage of “old age” is determined is crucial for our understanding of population aging. We propose that the old age threshold be determined using an equivalency criterion. People at the old age threshold should be roughly equivalent to one another in relevant characteristics regardless of when and where they lived. The UN publishes two variants of the potential support ratio based on different old age thresholds. One old age threshold is based on a fixed chronological age and the other on a fixed remaining life expectancy. Using historical data on 5-year death rates at the old age threshold as an indicator of one aspect of health, we assess the extent to which the two approaches are consistent with the equivalency criterion. The death rates are derived from all the complete cohort life tables in the Human Mortality Database. We show that the old age threshold based on a fixed remaining life expectancy is consistent with the equivalency criterion, while the old age threshold based on a fixed chronological age is not. The picture of population aging that emerges when measures consistent with the equivalency criterion are used are markedly different from those that result when the equivalency criterion is violated. We recommend that measures of aging that violate the equivalency criterion should only be used in special circumstances where that violation is unimportant.",1,1594416321,longevity

&gt;Abstract: Calorie restriction (CR), the reduction of dietary intake below energy requirements while maintaining optimal nutrition, is the only known nutritional intervention with the potential to attenuate aging. Evidence from observational, preclinical, and clinical trials suggests the ability to increase life span by 1-5 years with an improvement in health span and quality of life lived. CR moderates intrinsic processes of aging through cellular and metabolic adaptations and reducing risk for the development of many cardiometabolic diseases. Yet, implementation of CR may require unique considerations for the elderly and other specific populations. **The objectives of this review are to summarize the evidence for CR to modify primary and secondary aging; present caveats for implementation in special populations; describe newer, alternative approaches that have comparative effectiveness and fewer deleterious effects; and provide thoughts on the future of this important field of study.**

No conflicts were declared.

This review looks at animal and observational research regarding calorie restriction and the potential lifespan benefits, as well as incorporating an analysis of the interventional [CALERIE trials](https://calerie.duke.edu/publications).  The review also covers a bit about fasting and considerations for muscle loss and the elderly.

A bit about benefits of CR even at a 'healthy' BMI:

&gt;The CALERIE studies show that CR, even in already-healthy individuals with normal-range BMI, can effectively reduce both subcutaneous and visceral fat deposits, which are associated with improved cardiometabolic health. Moreover, benefits in ectopic fat deposition were also observed. CR reduced intrahepatic lipid content after 12 months but not after 24 months, while
intramyocellular lipid remained unchanged after 12 months but was significantly decreased after 24 months. It is noteworthy that individuals in these trials were healthy and had very low levels of ectopic fat to begin with. Nevertheless, improvements in ectopic fat were associated with improved insulin sensitivity and cardiometabolic health. While the extent of FM loss was similar between males and females, sex had a significant effect on FFM loss: Males evidenced greater
declines than females....A post hoc analysis of CALERIE data showed
that increased physical activity is the most promising strategy to counteract reductions in FFM.

A bit of sobering discussion on CALERIE compliance:

&gt;Arguably the greatest challenge for CR as a nutritional strategy to foster healthier aging is the ability to adequately sustain a reduction in calorie intake over many months and even years. As with most behavior-based interventions, compliance wavers over time. In CALERIE 1, 25% CR
was prescribed and 18% CR was achieved over 6 months. Similarly, participants achieved 19.5 ± 0.8% CR over the first 6 months in CALERIE 2, but compliance dropped off considerably to only 9.1 ± 0.7% during the remaining 18 months. The high level of compliance in the short term was facilitated by food provision. Thereafter, adherence was fostered by individual and group-based counseling by psychologists and nutritionists, weekly weight monitoring, and
diet tracking. The decline in individual support may also have contributed to the observed decline in adherence during the intervention. After the intervention, and thus with no structured support, the level of CR was only ∼5%, and consequently 54% of the initial weight loss (9.0 ± 0.6 kg) was regained. Furthermore, patients’ motivation may waver over time if they observe no additional obvious improvement (i.e., reduction in body weight). The compliance data from
CALERIE suggest that long-term maintenance of the diet strategy could limit clinical application.",1,1594173321,longevity

,shrillthrill,"Reason echoed the same sentiment:

&gt; The important point to consider here is that the TrueMe Labs assay is not a relabeling of any of the more established epigenetic clocks, those with significant research associated with their behavior. It is is its own beast, an independently developed test. It uses only 13 DNA methylation sites, and so it is very possible that it is much more sensitive to some interventions than others, in comparison to, say, the original Horvath clock, depending on which mechanisms influence those sites. Thus one cannot take any of the established research into the better studied clocks and use it to inform expectations as to how the TrueMe Labs assay will behave. 8.5 years might sound like a large effect size, but it is impossible to say whether or not that is the case.

&gt; That is the challenge with all epigenetic clocks, frankly. None are yet strongly connected to underlying mechanisms of aging; it is hard to say what any specific change or outcome actually represents in terms of metabolic processes. The assays will produce a number, but that number cannot be compared between clocks, and it cannot be compared between interventions. It cannot even be used to say how good any specific intervention might be, without a great deal of further calibration for that specific intervention. Not that one would learn that by reading the Ponce De Leon Health marketing materials. A cynic might suggest that they shopped for the clock that would produce the most sizable outcome for their intervention. Whether or not that is the case here, I'm sure that this strategy will become prevalent.

I'm incredibly skeptical that such a ""clock"" exists as a catch all term, nor do I believe such a thing would be plausible to use without targeting a factor of aging: if senolytics provide such wide swaths of health benefits, why shouldn't any ""clock"" be specific to the tissue type and the amount of senescent cell accumulation?

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) new, broader approach to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fortuitous one for the Buck Institute. Over decades the majority of NIH research dollars have been directed to looking at the sticky amyloid plaques and tau tangles which are present in the brains of those affected. Both features are hallmarks of AD, but neither has been conclusively proven to cause the memory- robbing disease. The bottom line: *After hundreds of failed clinical trials there is no successful treatment for the neurodegenerative disease, which is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S.*

Now the NIH is turning its attention to investing in geroscience, which focuses on the connection between aging and chronic disease. (The Buck coined the term “geroscience” and got the first federal grant to establish the field in 2007.) The new awards highlight the fact that aging is the largest risk factor for AD and the possibility that targeting the mechanisms of aging is a potential way to tame it.

The majority of the interventions—genetic, dietary, and pharmacological—that have been found to slow aging and protect against age-related disease in various organisms do so by targeting central metabolic pathways. However, targeting metabolic pathways chronically and ubiquitously makes it difficult to define the downstream effects responsible for lifespan extension and often results in negative effects on growth and health, limiting therapeutic potential. Insight into how metabolic signals are relayed between tissues, cells, and organelles opens up new avenues to target metabolic regulators locally rather than globally for healthy aging. In this review, we discuss the pro-longevity effects of targeting metabolic pathways in specific tissues and how these interventions communicate with distal cells to modulate aging. These studies may be crucial in designing interventions that promote longevity without negative health consequences.",1,1594047320,longevity
,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; Interactions between the sexes negatively impact health in many species, including mammals1–9. In mice, sexual interactions induce weight gain and shorten lifespan in females, independent of fertilization6,9. In Caenorhabditis, males shorten the lifespan of the opposite sex (females or hermaphrodites)1–3,8. However, the mechanisms underlying the negative influence of males on lifespan – and their overlap with known longevity pathways – are still largely unknown. Here, we use transcriptomic profiling and targeted screens to systematically uncover new conserved genes involved in male-induced demise. Interestingly, deficiency of these genes individually, and especially in combination, induces strong protection, highlighting the benefit of combining interventions to extend lifespan. Some genes (e.g. acbp-3, col-43) only extend hermaphrodite lifespan when knocked-down in the presence of males, suggesting specific protective mechanisms against male-induced demise. However, we also uncover two previously unknown longevity genes (sri-40 and delm-2) that, when knocked-down, extend hermaphrodite lifespan both with and without males, which points to new broad mechanisms of resistance. In sharp contrast, many classical long-lived mutants are actually short-lived in the presence of males, suggesting that males hijack and suppress known longevity pathways. This systematic analysis reveals striking differences in longevity in single sex versus mixed sex environments and uncovers the elaborate network of functional regulation elicited by sexual interactions, which could extend to other species.

* [Reddit discussion and news article: Researchers investigate drug that inhibits enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which may mitigate aging and extend life in older dogs. “While we love dogs, and we care about extending the life span of dogs for its own right, this is also a really good model for people, hopefully, in the future.”](https://old.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/dt3449/researchers_investigate_drug_that_inhibits_enzyme/)  

&gt; $4.2 million project studying close to 100 Alaskan sled dogs between the ages of 8 and 13, former athletes past their glory days. The study, which began in 2018, is a quest for one of the holy grails of medicine: how to slow aging.

&gt; Huson and co-leader Dr. John Loftus, assistant professor of small animal medicine in the College of Veterinary Medicine, are trying to determine whether a drug that inhibits an enzyme called reverse transcriptase can mitigate aging and extend life in older dogs. Private donations fund the project through the Vaika Foundation, a nonprofit group of scientists and veterinarians on a mission to extend the health and life span of domestic animals.

&amp;nbsp;

The dog aging project is another:

&gt; The goal of the Dog Aging Project is to understand how genes, lifestyle, and environment influence aging. We want to use that information to help dogs and people increase healthspan, the period of life spent free from disease. With help from you, we’ll gather information on thousands of participating dogs. We want to know what factors are associated with better health and longer lives. A subset of participating dogs will be selected to be part of a new clinical study to explore the potential of the drug rapamycin to improve healthspan.

It sounds like DNA sequencing is not just putting your saliva into a tube or on a petri dish and sticking it into a ""DNA sequencing machine"" and pressing the ""go"" button. But based on your description, it sounds like DNA sequencing is a multi-step process? Like you have to do something with/to your DNA sample(saliva, hair or blood etc.) to turn it into some product, then take that product and do something to it again in the next step before actually sticking it into the ""DNA sequencing machine"" and so on. 

Which mean this process(DNA sequencing) involves using multiple biotech-lab machines that do completely different things, no to mention understanding the purpose of just a few consumables you mentioned like ""reagents"" and small lab tools.

So before you can get your hands on the actual useful digital files (FASTQ, BAM, SAM or VCF), that will help you analyse and improve your health, you actually need to do some lab work with ""micropipettors, a vortex mixer, microcentrifuge, sequencers, tubes, pipette tips snd reagents"".

,shrillthrill,"Summary:

&gt; Aging is a process of cellular and tissue dysfunction characterized by different hallmarks, including cellular senescence. However, there is proof that certain features of aging and senescence can be ameliorated. Here, we provide evidence that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated from primary fibroblasts of young human donors ameliorate certain biomarkers of senescence in cells derived from old and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome donors. Importantly, sEVs from young cells ameliorate senescence in a variety of tissues in old mice.  

&gt; Mechanistically, we identified sEVs to have intrinsic glutathione-S-transferase activity partially due to the high levels of expression of the glutathione-related protein (GSTM2). Transfection of recombinant GSTM2 into sEVs derived from old fibroblasts restores their antioxidant capacity. sEVs increase the levels of reduced glutathione and decrease oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, our data provide an indication of the potential of sEVs as regenerative therapy in aging.

Significance:

&gt; In this work, we investigate novel strategies that could lead to improving wellbeing throughout life. As blood from young mice has the ability to rejuvenate old mice, we wanted to determine if extracellular vesicles (EVs), balloon-like structures released by cells, were involved.  

&gt; We find that EVs from young donor cells rejuvenate certain features of aging in mice and human cells, as they are very effective natural antioxidants. At present, there is a huge effort to determine pharmacological strategies to achieve rejuvenation, but most drugs are toxic. Instead, EVs are a natural source and do not induce toxicity or immunogenicity; thus, this study opens new avenues for strategies to improve lifelong health and wellbeing.",1,1593577109,longevity

Re-engineering an already living human to live for hundreds to thousands of years is such a daunting task that it might as well be regarded as impossible, and we aren't even close to the point where we know what changes need to be made to do that.

The whole idea of ""damage repair"" claims to be able to get around that obstacle through periodic maintenance, and I think to some extent that might work, but keep in mind the total chemical space encompassed by damage in aging is enormous, and the probability of adverse side effects from a drug exponentially increases the more you're talking at once, approaching 100% in a combination of 20 drugs.

That's why people like Kurzweil who take hundreds of pills every day in the hopes that at least some of them will be beneficial are out of their minds.

&gt; The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is associated with reduced longevity and increased Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Alzheimer’s disease, with e4e4 having markedly larger effect sizes than e3e4. The e2 longevity promoting variant is less studied. We conducted a phenome-wide association study of ApoE e2e3 and e2e2 with aging phenotypes, to assess their potential as targets for anti-aging interventions. Data were from 379,000 UK Biobank participants, aged 40 to 70 years. e2e3 (n=46,535) had mostly lower lipid-related biomarker levels including reduced total and LDL-cholesterol, and lower risks of CAD (Odds Ratio=0.87, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.90, p=4.92×10-14) and hypertension (OR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.97, p=7.28×10-7) versus e3e3.

,RandomUwUFace,"There was a study that UCLA released back in 2016 with a slightly click-baity title called ""Latinos age slower than other ethnicities, UCLA study shows"" which went viral on Twitter a few years ago. 

The study claimed that the blood of the Tismane people who are indigenous to Bolivia have slower aging blood when compared to White Americans; the article claimed that American Latinos aged slower  and lived longer(despite many suffering from obesity and other health risks) compared to White Americans due to them being genetically similar to the Tismane people.

It seems that people who are indigenous to the America's have slower aging blood, and the UCLA article implied that latino's have indigenous blood; the main problem is that many Latino's in the USA are probably mestizo(a mix of indigenous and european ancestry), which means that they don't age as slow when compared to full blooded indigenous people.


Cool findings from the [UCLA article:](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/latinos-age-slower-than-other-ethnicities-ucla-study-shows#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Centers%20for,expectancy%20of%2082%20versus%2079.&amp;text=According%20to%20Horvath%2C%20the%20UCLA,for%20Latinos'%20longer%20life%20spans.)

&gt;According to Horvath, the UCLA research points to an epigenetic explanation for Latinos’ longer life spans. For example, the biological clock measured Latino women’s age as 2.4 years younger than non-Latino women of the same age after menopause.

&gt;The Tsimane aged even more slowly than Latinos. The biological clock calculated the age of their blood as two years younger than Latinos and four years younger than Caucasians.

&gt;In another finding, the researchers learned that men’s blood and brain tissue ages faster than women’s from the same ethnic groups. The discovery could explain why women have a higher life expectancy than men.

&gt;“We suspect that Latinos’ slower aging rate helps neutralize their higher health risks, particularly those related to obesity and inflammation,” said Horvath


TLDR; 
People with AmerIndian ancestry have blood that ages slower compared to other ethnicities.

Female blood ages slower than male blood.

Slower aging could help neutralize the risk of heart disease and obesity(which might explain why latinos live longer despite having higher rates of obesity)

I think it will be possible to read numerous metabolic markers and determine a probability spread of health span in the future with the help of AI. I say that because any time you start to predict outcomes based on a high number of variables you are entering chaos theory which is not very good at deterministic outcomes. Honestly, teasing the signal out of the noise in an extraordinarily complex and dynamic system like human metabolism is, at this point, too blunt an instrument to give any meaningful results.

You could pick tests of cardio fitness, strength, mobility, sleep quality, cognitive function and other factors and determine if you are able to perform at, above, or below your age set.

Abstract:

&gt; SRT1720, a sirtuin1-activator, and metformin (MET), an antidiabetic drug, confer health and lifespan benefits when administered individually. It is unclear whether combination of the two compounds could lead to additional benefits. Groups of 56-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) alone or supplemented with either SRT1720 (2 g/kg food), a high dose of MET (1% w/w food), or a combination of both. Animals were monitored for survival, body weight, food consumption, body composition and rotarod performance. Mice treated with MET alone did not have improved longevity, and lifespan was dramatically reduced by combination of MET with SRT1720. Although all groups of animals were consuming similar amounts of food, mice on MET or MET+SRT1720 showed a sharp reduction in body weight. SRT1720+MET mice also had lower percent body fat combined with better performance on the rotarod compared to controls. These data suggest that co-treatment of SRT1720 with MET is detrimental to survival at the doses used and, therefore, risk-benefits of combining lifespan-extending drugs especially in older populations needs to be systematically evaluated.

&amp;nbsp;

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRT1720


&gt; In animal models of obesity and diabetes SRT1720 was found to improve insulin sensitivity and lower plasma glucose levels in fat, muscle and liver tissue, and increase mitochondrial and metabolic function.[1] In mice rendered obese and diabetic by feeding a high-fat, high-sugar diet, a study performed at the National Institute of Aging found that feeding chow infused with the highest dose of SRT1720 beginning at one year of age increased mean lifespan by 18%, and maximum lifespan by 5%, as compared to other short-lived obese, diabetic mice; however, treated animals still lived substantially shorter lives than normal-weight mice fed normal chow with no drug.[2] In a later study, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan of obese, diabetic mice by 21.7%, similar to the earlier study, but there was no effect on maximum lifespan in this study.[3] In normal-weight mice fed a standard rodent diet, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan by just 8.8%, and again had no effect on maximum lifespan.[3]",1,1592715512,longevity

&gt;**Again, linking the aggregates to the disease is actually entirely speculative. All the genetics tell us is that these pathways are related to the disease. I would parse this as there are different diseases, one somewhat more age-related than the other.**

Structurally speaking, the NFTs in the brain of an AD patient look rather different from the tau inclusions found in Lewy Body Dementia or Parkinson's. Meanwhile the spatial and temporal patterns of amyloid/tau pathology spread is different when comparing AD and FTD, and in general distinctive for each of the numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Incidentally, I and the authors of this reviews aren't talking about plaques and tangles, we're talking about soluble oligomers. Those induce a lot of stress in culture, specifically the kind of oxidative stress and DNA damage that we associate with senescence induction, which is probably part of why the plaques and tangles form in the first place, the cells would die off in masse if that stuff was just left flapping in the interstitial fluid.

When you compare LOAD and FAD, it's more or less the same in terms of both the structure of the aggregates and the pattern of their spread. I'd argue it's equally if not more speculative with what we know to say that FAD and LOAD are fundamentally different diseases given how different the various neurodegenerative diseases look from one another in terms of the associated aggregates. It's also not just FAD. Familial Frontal Temporal Dementia features aggregation prone species of tau protein. That's a very huge coincidence if there's no meaningful feedback from the aggregates/oligomers. It might not directly help us treat AD (in fact I think at this point it's a pretty safe bet it won't), but it helps us better understand the diversity of degenerative diseases.

&gt;**Holy shit. Just...no. The bacterial/viral correlation is entirely spurious, and the HSV/AD papers were slammed about a year after they came out using the much larger ROSMAP dataset. There is no correlation with gingivitis, HSV6/7, etc with AD. We have the lowest levels of persistent infectious disease (not to mention the best oral hygiene ever) for this to even remotely make sense. If this were the case, everyone in Britain would be walking around like a zombie by the time there were 30...**

Oh I agree it's fairly stupid, but if you want to force a connection there, you absolutely can, that was my point, some people I know just refuse to let that one go so I kind of have to mention it as an olive branch since I know they stalk me on reddit.

&gt;**Killing cells, even senescent cells, is not necessarily the correct thing. Clearly no on this forum has ever read the high profile reviews on this subject, otherwise they would all express a bit more health skepticism (Munoz-Espin et al., Nat. Rev. Cell. Bio, 2014 &amp; Kirkland, Nat. Rev. Cell Bio, 2020). Neurons cannot be by definition senescent, so it's probably going to require some truly unique strategies to address this potential issue.**

I have read those reviews, and the more recent primary literature on some of the potential pitfalls of eliminating senescent cells from tissues that don't readily turn over. 

That's particularly a problem if we're talking about neurons exhibiting a senescence like phenotype rather than expendable glial cells, but it's one option to consider, particularly in the early stages of disease where the senescence burden might not so severe but early cognitive impairment is still noticeable, and there's also the potential for incidental removal of senescent cells in the periphery in tissues where cells readily turn over to have an impact because of the systemic nature of circulating SASP factors.

As far as the point about neurons and senescence like growth arrest goes, drugs don't really care about the precise semantics, and if senescence-like growth arrest in neurons includes expression of the drug's mechanistic target it will still work, or if it's a nonspecific cytotoxic drug acting as a pro-drug via some constituent of the SASP.

  It's way better than the last, best hope for amyloid clearance where we're talking about treating people 25 years before they're symptomatic and maybe/probably it will only work in FAD where you're looking at starting treatment in their 20s. I am of course skeptically awaiting actual results in humans (by several of the authors of that review) to see what actually happens when this hypothesis is put into practice.

As far as actually treating late stage Alzheimer's Disease, enhancing autophagy is one option that could maybe slow things down a bit, but anything that would halt or reverse disease progression at that point is going to be out of our reach without serious advances in regenerative medicine.",1,1592714581,longevity
,alpha_as_f-ck,"I'm drunk, so I am actually feeling up to a half assed PbP reply to a random grad student on the internet who was triggered by my comment:

&gt;**Why, exactly? Any ""alternative hypothesis"" for the etiology of Alzheimer's Disease must explain all the previous observations to overturn the previous theories. That's how the scientific method works.**

First off, a history lesson. Alois Alzheimer described *presenile* dementia in August Dieter at the turn of the century (1900s). Later on, this is determined to be linked to waxy plaques in her brain. These plaques are composed of amyloid beta. Lots of people have amyloid beta plaques in their brains. No all have dementia (ex: Nun study).

Skip ahead to the 1960s-1970s. America riding a postwar high. NIH has money to burn. NIA decides that it needs to fight a disease - but doesn't have a big bad voodoo man like NCI. Enter Alzheimer's disease. The definition of the disease is expanded to include age-related dementias rather than presenile ones, and all of a sudden, age is the culprit. Skip ahead to the era of genetics and amyloid/presenilin are identified and the amyloid cascade hypothesis is formulated (ACH). So far, this hypothesis has not been validated in the lab or therapeutically (25 years later). Over time, it's grown close to Tau/neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a nonspecific maker of neuronal injury. Lately, the hypothesis's proponents have cozied on up to microglia/astrocytes/neuroinflammation. It's 95% bullshit done in mice (which don't get AD btw). Finally, NIH steps in a few years ago and announced ATN pathology. If you have plaques, but no dementia, you still have AD. We've now exploded our definition of the disease to be almost meaningless and encompass even the healthy.

What's the take away: amyloid is not indicative of AD. NFTs are not indicative of AD, just neuronal injury. Neuroinflammation can have a lot of causes, like age. Age is the number one risk factor for dementia. Not genetics.

&gt;**In the case of Alzheimer's, that includes detailed mechanistic studies of the proteins involved in Familial Alzheimer's Disease which have in no uncertain terms shown that FAD mutations lead to overproduction or enhanced aggregation of amyloid-beta. The veritable parade of AD clinical trial failures targeting amyloid-beta have pretty conclusively told us that the hypothesis is incomplete (which comes as a surprise to absolutely nobody but old timers who staked their entire career on it), but it's very hard to dismiss the link between FAD and amyloid-beta.**

Again, linking the aggregates to the disease is actually entirely speculative. All the genetics tell us is that these pathways are related to the disease. I would parse this as there are different diseases, one somewhat more age-related than the other.

&gt;**Of the leading alternatives to the amyloid cascade, the models based on bacterial/viral correlations run into (again) the problem of how exactly we explain FAD if senile plaques and NFTs are assumed to be an epiphenomenon. Senescent cells on the other hand, fit very well with that existing data, and undergo metabolic changes which would predict enhanced internalization of the prion-like oligomers of a-beta and tau the amyloid people have started to focus on. It's not incompatible with previous data, and explains a whole lot. Incidentally because infection can activate many of the same pathways (ie the interferon response to viral infection) that are involved in the SASP, the senescent cell angle can also accommodate the infectious disease angle if you want it to. That's what I call parsimony, and it's actually something I'm actively working on because I consider it extremely promising.**

Holy shit. Just...no. The bacterial/viral correlation is entirely spurious, and the HSV/AD papers were slammed about a year after they came out using the much larger ROSMAP dataset. There is no correlation with gingivitis, HSV6/7, etc with AD. We have the lowest levels of persistent infectious disease (not to mention the best oral hygiene ever) for this to even remotely make sense. If this were the case, everyone in Britain would be walking around like a zombie by the time there were 30...

There is some lovely preliminary work out there on neuronal senescence like phenotypes (I know a few of the authors personally). I await more definitive research on the subject (&lt;10 good papers really doesn't cut it). Genetics don't work for age-related disease, in part because stuff is no longer working on the same pitch. As for parsimony, this is missing the forest for the trees in the wrong fucking forest.

&gt;**As for what we do about that treatment wise if it's correct, senolytics are one answer, though that depends greatly on the extent to which neurons exhibiting a senescence like phenotype are present. Especially for neurodegeneration, there's a paucity of disease modifying interventions, so even the serious off target effects and on-target toxicities of repurposed chemo drugs would be acceptable as a starting point.**

Killing cells, even senescent cells, is not necessarily the correct thing. Clearly no on this forum has ever read the high profile reviews on this subject, otherwise they would all express a bit more health skepticism (Munoz-Espin et al., Nat. Rev. Cell. Bio, 2014 &amp; Kirkland, Nat. Rev. Cell Bio, 2020). Neurons cannot be by definition senescent, so it's probably going to require some truly unique strategies to address this potential issue.

&gt;**Of course, in late stage AD clearing senescent cells in the brain might just kill people.**

,StoicOptom,"&gt; Abstract

&gt; Produced by senescent cells, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is a potential driver of age-related dysfunction. We tested whether circulating concentrations of SASP proteins reflect age and medical risk in humans. We first screened senescent endothelial cells, fibroblasts, preadipocytes, epithelial cells, and myoblasts to identify candidates for human profiling. We then tested associations between circulating SASP proteins and clinical data from individuals throughout the life span and older adults undergoing surgery for prevalent but distinct age-related diseases. A community-based sample of people aged 20–90 years (retrospective cross-sectional) was studied to test associations between circulating SASP factors and chronological age. A subset of this cohort aged 60–90 years and separate cohorts of older adults undergoing surgery for severe aortic stenosis (prospective longitudinal) or ovarian cancer (prospective case-control) were studied to assess relationships between circulating concentrations of SASP proteins and biological age (determined by the accumulation of age-related health deficits) and/or postsurgical outcomes. We showed that SASP proteins were positively associated with age, frailty, and adverse postsurgery outcomes. A panel of 7 SASP factors composed of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS), osteopontin (OPN), TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), ACTIVIN A, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), and IL-15 predicted adverse events markedly better than a single SASP protein or age. **Our findings suggest that the circulating SASP may serve as a clinically useful candidate biomarker of age-related health and a powerful tool for interventional human studies.**

Really cool paper, could potentially be superior to the frailty index that is currently used in clinical practice imo.

&gt; Among 2 samples of older adults undergoing surgery for distinct age-related diseases, **individual SASP proteins** showed predictive power for adverse postoperative events greater than chronological age, and **greater than or equal to that of frailty index–defined biological age**. Notably, a panel of 7 candidate biomarkers exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for adverse outcome risk prediction in participants undergoing surgery for either ovarian cancer or severe aortic stenosis.",1,1592560548,longevity

&gt; Studying health and lifespan in dogs is important both for the dogs themselves and also because it is important for human health and well-being. Dogs live in the same environment as humans, receive similar care, and get many of the same diseases. The Dog Aging Project (www.dogagingproject.org) uses veterinary data from dogs to benefit both dog and human health.

&gt; Several types of data have been used to study lifespan in dogs, including university hospital records, corporate practice records, and pet insurance data. Private practice data exist for the UK, but have not been published for the US. We collected data from three private US veterinary clinics over 1 year, representing 20,970 dogs, of which 1535 (7.3%) died during this year. We had information on age, breed, weight, sex, gonadectomy status, and cause of death if applicable, and then studied how these factors influence lifespan in dogs.

&gt; We found that large dogs do not live as long as small dogs on average, which is known and increases our confidence in our data. We also found that dogs that were gonadectomized lived longer than intact dogs, with a bigger effect in females than in males. While we did not find a lifespan difference between purebred and mixed breed dogs, we found that dog breeds with more genetic diversity lived longer than breeds with less, as measured by inbreeding coefficients and effective population sizes. Additionally, dogs in a specific genetic cluster of breeds (“Mountain ancestral group”) tended to live shorter, and this difference is not explained by their larger size.

&gt; This is the first large study of lifespan in dogs seen in non-corporate private veterinary practice in the US. We are able to collect and analyze such data, which will be useful as the Dog Aging Project progresses. We also show that gonadectomy appears to have different effects in males versus females and needs to be considered separately by sex, and that breeds with more genetic diversity appear to live longer than those with less genetic diversity. More research is needed to determine whether age at the time of gonadectomy impacts survival, and to understand what causes the decreased lifespan in the Mountain ancestral group breeds.",1,1592435992,longevity

Abstract:

&gt; The impact of chronic caloric restriction (CR) on health and survival is complex with poorly understood underlying molecular mechanisms. A recent study in mice addressing the diets used in nonhuman primate CR studies found that while diet composition did not impact longevity, fasting time and total calorie intake were determinant for increased survival. Here, integrated analysis of physiological and multi-omics data from ad libitum, meal-fed, or CR animals was used to gain insight into pathways associated with improved health and survival. We identified a potential involvement of the glycine-serine-threonine metabolic axis in longevity and related molecular mechanisms. Direct comparison of the different feeding strategies unveiled a pattern of shared pathways of improved health that included short-chain fatty acids and essential PUFA metabolism. These findings were recapitulated in the serum metabolome from nonhuman primates. We propose that the pathways identified might be targeted for their potential role in healthy aging.",1,1592431635,longevity

&gt; Aging involves decline in a range of functional abilities and phenotypes, many of which are also associated with socioeconomic status (SES). Here we assessed whether lower SES is a determinant of the rate of decline over 8 y in six domains—physical capability, sensory function, physiological function, cognitive performance, emotional well-being, and social function—in a sample of 5,018 men and women aged 64.44 (SD 8.49) y on average at baseline. Wealth was used as the marker of SES, and all analyses controlled for age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and long-term health conditions. Lower SES was associated with greater adverse changes in physical capability (grip strength, gait speed, and physical activity), sensory function (sight impairment), physiological function (plasma fibrinogen concentration and lung function), cognitive performance (memory, executive function, and processing speed), emotional well-being (enjoyment of life and depressive symptoms), and social function (organizational membership, number of close friends, volunteering, and cultural engagement). Effects were maintained when controlling statistically for other factors such as smoking, marital/partnership status, and self-rated health and were also present when analyses were limited to participants aged ≤75 y.

,basmwklz,"&gt; Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cardiac pathophysiology. Defects in mitochondrial performance disrupt contractile function, overwhelm myocytes with reactive oxygen species (ROS), and transform these cellular powerhouses into pro-death organelles. Thus, quality control (QC) pathways aimed at identifying and removing damaged mitochondrial proteins, components, or entire mitochondria are crucial processes in post-mitotic cells such as cardiac myocytes. Almost all of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and the trafficking of these nuclear-encoded proteins necessitates significant cross-talk with the cytosolic protein QC machinery to ensure that only functional proteins are delivered to the mitochondria. Within the organelle, mitochondria contain their own protein QC system consisting of chaperones and proteases. This system represents another level of QC to promote mitochondrial protein folding and prevent aggregation. If this system is overwhelmed, a conserved transcriptional response known as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response is activated to increase the expression of proteins involved in restoring mitochondrial proteostasis. If the mitochondrion is beyond repair, the entire organelle must be removed before it becomes cytotoxic and causes cellular damage. Recent evidence has also uncovered mitochondria as participants in cytosolic protein QC where misfolded cytosolic proteins can be imported and degraded inside mitochondria. However, this process also places increased pressure on mitochondrial QC pathways to ensure that the imported proteins do not cause mitochondrial dysfunction. This review is focused on discussing the pathways involved in regulating mitochondrial QC and their relationship to cellular proteostasis and mitochondrial health in the heart.",1,1592302085,longevity

In 2006 was initiated a long-term project, called the “Restrikal study”, which was aimed at assessing the effects of chronic-moderate CR in a nonhuman primate species1. Our 2018 publication of the main results of the Restrikal study2 brought new arguments in this debate.

In this study, we subjected a cohort of young adult gray mouse lemurs to a 30% CR diet, compared to a control group, until their natural death. The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small malagasy primate with numerous similarities to humans, in particular during aging, for which it represents a promising and emerging model3,4. Compared to control animals showing a median survival time of 6.4 years, CR extended survival by 50%, reduced aging-associated diseases and preserved loss of brain white matter in several brain regions. However, CR accelerated loss of gray matter throughout much of the cerebrum. Up to five years of treatment, CR did not change the cognitive status in spatial and working memory tests or neuromuscular performances. Thus, chronic-moderate CR does extend lifespan and enhance health of a primate, but at the expense of brain gray matter integrity.

Two studies on the impact of CR on health and lifespan had been previously initiated in rhesus monkeys5,6. Their investigators initially reported contradictory results on survival7, but finally concluded to a positive impact of CR on health and survival though their mortality curves were still incomplete8. In this context, our study brought the most advanced survival dataset for a primate under CR (all control animals were dead at the time of the publication) with very strong effect of calorie restriction on all-cause mortality. Since our publication in Communications Biology in April 2018, all calorie-restricted mouse lemurs are now dead, demonstrating an increase in maximum lifespan of more than 22% (13.8 years in the restricted group vs. 11.3 years in the control group, Fig. 1).

It's clear that there needs to be a ton of time on rout memorization  and the practical element of treating disease.

Frankly I wouldnt even trust most physicians to critically analyze a research paper or understand the statistical analyses involved. Unless they have come from an MS or PhD background, which to be fair, is a very low amount. It's a complete and horrible shame and travesty that they are then unfortunately given the ""gatekeeper"" status for many of these things. Doctors are NOT trained in keeping someone healthy but to stem the flow of disease and act in an emergency, reactive manner. 

Their governing bodies tend to be very conservative and most individuals severely lack keeping up on the lagesy literature and then have the gall to be condescending if you bring them research to ask for something (probably because they don't have the time or ability to read and understand it themselves, coupled with, in general, a bit of a god/superiority complex as though it's only the highest intellects that become doctors 🙄). Then, if something is approved by the actual scientists at say, the FDA, it's still a fucking hassle to try to get most doctors to understand and prescribe unless you're a pharma company that wines and dines them to try to get them to prescribe your drug (money talks, even in medicine). There ARE some real good ones out there, but in my opinion are BY FAR the minority. The fucking condescending attitude of most doctors is complete bullshit. I already saw an, apparently, ER doc comment and totally dismiss a part of your comment without any critical engagement. That's the type of BS we're dealing with.

It doesn't help that the focus is just on pushing people with a good GPA in and ignoring others, regardless of academic rigor or interest.

Its fucking disgusting, I'd never want him as my doctor unless he ends up being one of those who are so inept that they just do everything you ask to save the hassle. But I'd never want this person to a t on their own accord for my health. Fact is, that's not all that unusual because medicine is a huge paying career in the US due to private interests and will fight tooth and nail against any kind of reform.

&gt; Age-related disease burdens increased over time, and whether plasma peptides can be used to accurately predict age in order to explain the variation in biological indicators remains inadequately understood. Here we first developed a biological age model based on plasma peptides in 1890 Chinese Han adults. Based on mass spectrometry, 84 peptides were detected with masses in the range of 0.6-10.0 kDa, and 13 of these peptides were identified as known amino acid sequences. Five of these thirteen plasma peptides, including fragments of apolipoprotein A-I (m/z 2883.99), fibrinogen alpha chain (m/z 3060.13), complement C3 (m/z 2190.59), complement C4-A (m/z 1898.21), and breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (m/z 1607.84) were finally included in the final model by performing a multivariate linear regression with stepwise selection. This biological age model accounted for 72.3% of the variation in chronological age. Furthermore, the linear correlation between the actual age and biological age was 0.851 (95% confidence interval: 0.836-0.864) and 0.842 (95% confidence interval: 0.810-0.869) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The biological age based on plasma peptides has potential positive effects on primary prevention, and its biological meaning warrants further investigation.

Intro:

&gt; The trends toward an increased aged population (the proportion of individuals aged 65 years and over) is a major public health problem, especially in China [1, 2]. Worldwide, the estimated number of elderly population was 962 million in 2017, and the growing rate was approximately 3% per year [3]. China has the largest elderly population in the world, with more than 225 million elderly people. The number of elderly people in China is projected to be 400 million by 2030 [4].

&gt; The absence of clinical tools to evaluate individual variation in the pace of aging represents a major impediment to understanding aging and maximizing health throughout life. The human lens is an ideal tissue for quantitative assessment of molecular aging in vivo. Long-lived proteins in lens fiber cells are expressed during fetal life, do not undergo turnover, accumulate molecular alterations throughout life, and are optically accessible in vivo. We used quasi-elastic light scattering (QLS) to measure age-dependent signals in lenses of healthy human subjects. Age-dependent QLS signal changes detected in vivo recapitulated time-dependent changes in hydrodynamic radius, protein polydispersity, and supramolecular order of human lens proteins during long-term incubation (~1 year) and in response to sustained oxidation (~2.5 months) in vitro.

The median healthy life span of creatine-fed mice was 9% higher than in their control littermates, and they performed significantly better in neurobehavioral tests.  
&gt; In brains of creatine-treated mice, there was a trend toward a reduction of reactive oxygen species and significantly lower accumulation of the ""aging pigment"" lipofuscin. Expression profiling showed an upregulation of genes implicated in neuronal growth, neuroprotection, and learning. These data showed that creatine improves health and longevity in mice. Creatine may, therefore, be a promising food supplement to promote healthy human aging.  
&gt; However, the strong neuroprotective effects in animal studies of creatine have not been reproduced in human clinical trials (that have been conducted in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

In the study researchers measured nutrient-dependent changes in lifespan and tracked age-related changes in physical activity to measure healthspan. While 97 percent of strains showed some lifespan or healthspan extension in response to dietary restriction, only 50 percent of strains showed a significantly positive response to dietary restriction for both. Thirteen percent of the strains were more vigorous, yet died sooner with dietary restriction; 5 percent lived longer, but spent more time in poor health. The remaining 32 percent of the strains showed no benefits or detriments to lifespan or healthspan, or negative responses to both.

""Our study is surprising and gives a glimpse into what's likely going to happen in humans, because we're all different and will likely respond differently to the effects of dietary restriction. Furthermore, our results question the idea that lifespan extension will always be accompanied by improvement of healthspan.""

Paper:  [GWAS for Lifespan and Decline in Climbing Ability in Flies upon Dietary Restriction Reveal decima as a Mediator of Insulin-like Peptide Production [2020, open-access]](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20\)30659-X)

Abstract:

&gt; Dietary restriction (DR) is the most robust means to extend lifespan and delay age-related diseases across species. An underlying assumption in the aging field is that DR enhances both lifespan and physical activity through similar mechanisms, but this has not been rigorously tested in different genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, nutrient response genes responsible for lifespan extension or age-related decline in functionality remain underexplored in natural populations. To address this, we measured nutrient-dependent changes in lifespan and age-related decline in climbing ability in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel fly strains. On average, DR extended lifespan and delayed decline in climbing ability, but there was a lack of correlation between these traits across individual strains, suggesting that distinct genetic factors modulate these traits independently and that genotype determines response to diet. Only 50% of strains showed positive response to DR for both lifespan and climbing ability, 14% showed a negative response for one trait but not both, and 35% showed no change in one or both traits. Through GWAS, we uncovered a number of genes previously not known to be diet responsive nor to influence lifespan or climbing ability. We validated decima as a gene that alters lifespan and daedalus as one that influences age-related decline in climbing ability. We found that decima influences insulin-like peptide transcription in the GABA receptor neurons downstream of short neuropeptide F precursor (sNPF) signaling. Modulating these genes produced independent effects on lifespan and physical activity decline, which suggests that these age-related traits can be regulated through distinct mechanisms.",1,1591442742,longevity

,AtroposBenedict,"You cover a lot of ground in this video, addressing many potential contributors to the sex/lifespan gap. However, I think this question is best answered with the parsimony principle in mind: the simplest explanation is probably the correct one. I think the simplest explanation for women living longer than men is that women are smaller than men.

Theoretically, being smaller should confer two main benefits. First, being smaller should decrease cancer risk: if every cell in a body has a specific lifetime risk of becoming cancerous, and if these risks are additive, then having fewer cells means a lower lifetime risk of developing cancer. Second, being smaller should decrease the number of cell divisions that any given cell has experienced, given that fewer cell divisions are necessary to reach the body's total cell count. Each cell division introduces mutations, shortens telomeres, and is an opportunity for somatic aneuploidies - all other things being equal, a cell that has undergone fewer divisions is probably a healthier cell.

Empirically, there is evidence that being bigger shortens lifespan. The most available example is dogs, where larger breeds show various health defects and develop more degenerative diseases sooner. Although female dogs do not live longer than male dogs, male and female dogs are [nearly the same size](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046125). Bigger breeds living shorter lives seems to be a common trend across species, seen also in [rabbits](http://www.bunnyhugga.com/a-to-z/general/) and [horses](https://animals.mom.me/long-average-equines-life-span-10265.html). However, note that this trend only holds \*within\* species, not \*between\* species - big bowhead whales live longer than small minke whales, big capybaras live longer than small guinea pigs, big Galapagos tortoises live longer than small yellow-footed tortoises, etc.

Between men and women, the difference in size is more than large enough to account for the difference in lifespan. The [Lovich-Gibbons ratio](https://europepmc.org/article/med/1487365) tries to quantify the difference in size between males and females. According to the CDC, in the interval [2011-2014](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_039.pdf), the average height for adult men was 175.7 cm and 161.8 cm for women, which translates to an L-G ratio of 1.086. In 2013, the US life expectancy was 76.4 for men and 81.2 for women, a ratio of 1.063. If we crudely assume that a 1% increase in size is associated with a 1% decrease in lifespan, then the difference in size between men and women would be more than enough to explain their difference in lifespan.

There are many possible explanations for the the difference in lifespan between men and women, but size is an explanation that is simple, has supporting evidence in other species, and offers a convenient explanation for the similar magnitudes of size sexual dimorphism and lifespan sexual dimorphism. A weakness of this hypothesis is that it predicts shorter people should live longer than taller people, which does not appear to be true; however, this is  confounded by the correlations between height, childhood health, and socioeconomic status.

,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; The accumulation of senescent cells can drive many age-associated phenotypes and pathologies. Consequently, it has been proposed that removing senescent cells might extend lifespan. Here, we generated two knockin mouse models targeting the best-characterized marker of senescence, p16Ink4a. Using a genetic lineage tracing approach, we found that age-induced p16High senescence is a slow process that manifests around 10–12 months of age. The majority of p16High cells were vascular endothelial cells mostly in liver sinusoids (LSECs), and to lesser extent macrophages and adipocytes. In turn, continuous or acute elimination of p16High senescent cells disrupted blood-tissue barriers with subsequent liver and perivascular tissue fibrosis and health deterioration. Our data show that senescent LSECs are not replaced after removal and have important structural and functional roles in the aging organism. In turn, delaying senescence or replacement of senescent LSECs could represent a powerful tool in slowing down aging.

,WizardCalamity,"Title: The quest to slow ageing through drug discovery

Abstract:
&gt;Although death is inevitable, individuals have long sought to alter the course of the ageing process. Indeed, ageing has proved to be modifiable; by intervening in biological systems, such as nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, the systemic environment and the gut microbiome, phenotypes of ageing can be slowed sufficiently to mitigate age-related functional decline. These interventions can also delay the onset of many disabling, chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration, in animal models. Here, we examine the most promising interventions to slow ageing and group them into two tiers based on the robustness of the preclinical, and some clinical, results, in which the top tier includes rapamycin, senolytics, metformin, acarbose, spermidine, NAD+ enhancers and lithium. We then focus on the potential of the interventions and the feasibility of conducting clinical trials with these agents, with the overall aim of maintaining health for longer before the end of life.

,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; The FDA approved drug rapamycin can prolong lifespan in diverse species and delay the onset of age-related disease in mammals. However, a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the mechanisms by which rapamycin modulates age-related pathophysiology and lifespan. Alterations in the gut microbiota can impact host physiology, metabolism and lifespan. While recent studies have shown that rapamycin treatment alters the gut microbiota in aged animals, the causal relationships between rapamycin treatment, microbiota dynamics and aging are not known. Here, using Drosophila as a model organism, we show that rapamycin-mediated alterations in microbiota dynamics in aged flies are associated with improved markers of intestinal and muscle aging. Critically, however, we show that the beneficial effects of rapamycin treatment on tissue aging and lifespan are not dependent upon the microbiota. Indeed, germ-free flies show delayed onset of intestinal barrier dysfunction, improved proteostasis in aged muscles and a significant lifespan extension upon rapamycin treatment. In contrast, genetic inhibition of autophagy impairs the ability of rapamycin to mediate improved gut health and proteostasis during aging. Our results indicate that rapamycin-mediated modulation of the microbiota in aged animals is not causally required to slow tissue and organismal aging.",1,1590755771,longevity
,frankschueler,"The Forever Healthy Foundation announces the public launch of the [Risk-Benefit Analysis of Dasatinib + Quercetin as a](https://brain.forever-healthy.org/display/EN/Rejuvenation+Now)[ Senolytic Therapy](https://brain.forever-healthy.org/display/EN/Rejuvenation+Now), a structured review of the published evidence. It is the fifth publication of Forever Healthy's ""Rejuvenation Now"" initiative following the ""Risk &amp; Benefit Analysis of Vascular Rejuvenation using EDTA"".  


Forever Healthy's ""[Rejuvenation Now](https://www.forever-healthy.org/rejuvenation-now.html)"" initiative seeks to continuously identify potential rejuvenation therapies and systematically evaluates them on risks, benefits, and therapeutic protocols to create transparency regarding the current state of said therapies.  


Dasatinib + Quercetin - a powerful rejuvenation therapy?  


When a cell reaches the end of its life or becomes damaged beyond repair it normally either kills itself or signals the immune system to remove it. Unfortunately, every so often this mechanism fails. The cell stays around indefinitely and starts poisoning its environment. Over time, more and more of these harmful, death resistant, senescent cells accumulate. Senescent cells are thought to be one of the main drivers of aging and age-related diseases.  


Senolytics are drugs that selectively remove senescent cells by disabling the mechanisms that allow them to survive. Dasatinib (D), a well-established medication used in the treatment of cancer and quercetin (Q), a flavonoid common in plants were among the first senolytics to be discovered. As they have been shown to affect different types of senescent cells, they are often employed in combination.   


Studies in rodents have shown that clearing senescent cells can prevent, delay, or alleviate multiple age-related diseases and extend the healthy lifespan by up to 35%. Based on the promising results in animal testing, it is supposed that intermittent dosing of D+Q also leads to the elimination of senescent cells in humans with the accompanying health and rejuvenation benefits.  


As the first clinical trials in humans have been completed and interest in the practical application of D+Q is increasing, Forever Healthy seeks to assess the risks, benefits, and therapeutic protocols of using D+Q as a senolytic therapy.  


Methods &amp; Results  


For this risk and benefit analysis, the team at Forever Healthy screened more than 3300 scientific papers and included over 150 clinical and pre-clinical studies in its analysis.  


Currently, there are only results from 3 trials in humans in which D+Q was evaluated as a senolytic therapy. The majority of human studies used D or Q in cancer therapy and provided information on side effects and safety.  
The benefits shown in animals were significant and were observed in many organ systems. However, several of the benefits only occurred in diseased animals (i.e. diabetic mice), while the healthy control group did not benefit from the treatment.   


The benefits reported in human studies are mainly focussed on senescent cell markers. So far, these markers are only hypothesized to translate to clinically meaningful effects. Few benefits had direct clinical relevance, and those were not really convincing. Additionally, 2 out of the 3 clinical studies were in patients with pre-existing disease so there is very limited information on the effect in healthy individuals.  


The potential risks of D are extensive and well-known through its use in the treatment of cancer. While the clinical trials that used D+Q as a senolytic therapy reported only mild to moderate adverse events, it is of note that the low number of participants in these studies might not deliver a representative result.  


Furthermore, the human studies all used different treatment protocols and there is no consensus on the measurement of efficacy in clinical practice.   


Therefore, until there are more studies showing benefits in humans, a clearer picture of the senolytic-use specific risk profile, and a consensus on a treatment protocol, it seems prudent to avoid the use of D+Q as a senolytic therapy.

,shrillthrill,"About James L. Kirkland:

&gt; James L. Kirkland, MD, PhD: 2020 Irving S. Wright Award | James L. Kirkland, MD, PhD, is the Director of the [Robert and
Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-arlene-kogod-center-aging/contact/support-aging-research/) and Noaber Foundation Professor of Aging Research. Dr. Kirkland’s research
focuses on cellular senescence, age-related adipose tissue and metabolic dysfunction, and development of agents and
strategies for targeting fundamental aging mechanisms to treat age-related chronic diseases and disabilities and to extend
healthspan.  
&gt; He published the first article about drugs that clear senescent cells, senolytic agents. A novel, mechanism-based,
hypothesis-driven drug development paradigm was used to discover senolytic drugs. Based on the observation that senescent
cells release factors that cause apoptosis of the cells around them, yet are themselves resistant to apoptosis, Dr. Kirkland
hypothesized that senescent cells utilize senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs) for protection from their own
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Using bioinformatics analyses of senescent vs. non-senescent cells and
RNA interference, Dr. Kirkland identified these SCAPs and verified their importance for senescent cell survival. Dr. Kirkland
used bioinformatics approaches to identify agents that target key nodes across the SCAP network and demonstrated these
drugs are senolytic in rodent and human cultured cells and mice in vivo. These senolytic drugs include Dasatinib (D), Quercetin
(Q), Fisetin, Navitoclax, and related compounds. Dr. Kirkland showed these agents delay, prevent, or alleviate multiple disorders
in mouse models of human chronic diseases and aging phenotypes.  
&gt; Conditions alleviated in mouse models include frailty,
diabetes, hepatic steatosis, cirrhosis, renal dysfunction, neuropsychiatric disorders, dementias, pulmonary fibrosis, osteoporosis,
osteoarthritis, retinal degeneration, diastolic dysfunction, cardiac ischemia, vascular hyporeactivity, infertility, and skin disorders,
among others. He demonstrated that intermittent, orally administered senolytics reduce senescent cell abundance in adipose
tissue and blood markers of senescent cell burden in blood of patients with diabetic kidney disease.  
&gt; He and collaborators found
that a brief course of senolytics enhances physical function and reduces frailty in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a
fatal, cellular-senescence-driven disease for which available treatments have been unsatisfactory. Multiple clinical trials are
currently underway of the senolytics that Dr. Kirkland discovered. He is a scientific advisory board member for several
companies and academic organizations. In addition to being President-Elect of AFAR, he has been a member of the National

,StoicOptom,"What baffles me the most about the longevity field is that when I talk to biomedical researchers or clinicians, the vast majority know nearly nothing about biogerontology/geroscience, let alone the basic principles and rationale for why we should be funding the shit out of this research. 

Initiatives like this video are good but I'm not sure how effective it really is when we consider that there's a small, concentrated group of people (billionaires, politicians, NIH Directors, 'star' academics?) who actually have the influence to do something about it.

Also, it just doesn't make sense to me how we can have research such as Mayo Clinic's senolytic data where a single therapy increases both healthspan and lifespan by ameliorating dozens of age-related disease at once, and still see a near-complete lack of awareness by the average biomedical researcher or health professional.

To some extent it reminds me of the Upton Sinclair quote: ""*It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.*"" 

I expect that a lot of heads will roll in the coming decades when therapeutic breakthroughs in aging research make it increasingly harder to justify funding for the majority of 'single disease' research. This is something I like speculating about; if we significantly alter the course of aging then the demand for aged care workers, health professionals, nurses, physicians, 'single disease' biomedical researchers etc. will eventually plummet - I think we're in for radical change in the coming decades.",1,1590322830,longevity

&gt;	Mitochondria are multidimensional organelles whose activities are essential to cellular vitality and organismal longevity, yet underlying regulatory mechanisms spanning these different levels of organization remain elusive1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear transcription factor Y, beta subunit (NFYB-1), a subunit of the NF-Y transcriptional complex6,7,8, is a crucial regulator of mitochondrial function. Identified in RNA interference (RNAi) screens, NFYB-1 loss leads to perturbed mitochondrial gene expression, reduced oxygen consumption, mitochondrial fragmentation, disruption of mitochondrial stress pathways, decreased mitochondrial cardiolipin levels and abolition of organismal longevity triggered by mitochondrial impairment. Multi-omics analysis reveals that NFYB-1 is a potent repressor of lysosomal prosaposin, a regulator of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Limiting prosaposin expression unexpectedly restores cardiolipin production, mitochondrial function and longevity in the nfyb-1 background. Similarly, cardiolipin supplementation rescues nfyb-1 phenotypes. These findings suggest that the NFYB-1–prosaposin axis coordinates lysosomal to mitochondria signalling via lipid pools to enhance cellular mitochondrial function and organismal health.

,shrillthrill,"Regarding telomere testing:

While [telomere attrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/) is considered to be a hallmark of aging, it's not clear whether simple measurements can be made from blood tests of leukocyte telomere length.  Many authors note that telomere length may vary across in different organs and this needs further research.   For example:

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

[Analysis of the Association Between TERC and TERT Genetic Variation and Leukocyte Telomere Length and Human Lifespan—A Follow-Up Study (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/2/82/htm)

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

['This test is garbage': Experts in telomere biology and former employees allege that a Silicon Valley startup gives bogus 'cellular ages' based on a flawed blood test](https://www.thisisinsider.com/silicon-valley-telomere-blood-test-2018-9):

&gt; Elizabeth Blackburn, a biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, who won the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, in 2009, cofounded Telomere Diagnostics in 2010. The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

&gt; Elissa Epel, another UCSF researcher who cofounded the company with Blackburn, left at the same time for the same reasons.

&gt; Both researchers told Business Insider that they questioned the efficacy of Telomere Diagnostics' test. And a former Telomere Diagnostics employee said she witnessed practices that raised doubts about the company's cleanliness, commitment to scientific accuracy, and handling of private health information.

&gt;  the links between telomere length, health, and aging are not yet clear cut.

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been tied to higher rates of disease, faster tumor growth, and overall age-related degeneration. But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal. That means that we still do not fully understand telomeres or their role in aging and disease. So trying to lengthen or shorten your telomeres as a health intervention is arguably premature and, at worst, harmful, some experts say.",1,1589948265,longevity

Abstract:

&gt; Obesity is a top public health concern, and a molecule that safely treats obesity is urgently needed. Disulfiram (known commercially as Antabuse), an FDA-approved treatment for chronic alcohol addiction, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and helps protect against certain types of cancer. Here, we show that in mice disulfiram treatment prevented body weight gain and abrogated the adverse impact of an obesogenic diet on insulin responsiveness while mitigating liver steatosis and pancreatic islet hypertrophy. Additionally, disulfiram treatment reversed established diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in middle-aged mice. Reductions in feeding efficiency and increases in energy expenditure were associated with body weight regulation in response to long-term disulfiram treatment. Loss of fat tissue and an increase in liver fenestrations were also observed in rats on disulfiram. Given the potent anti-obesogenic effects in rodents, repurposing disulfiram in the clinic could represent a new strategy to treat obesity and its metabolic comorbidities.",1,1589547151,longevity

Also, [George Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Church) announced in December 2018 that his company [Rejuvenate Bio](http://www.rejuvenatebio.com/) has developed an experimental gene therapy targeting the NAD+ pathway.

We've got a long way to go before there's evidence for it being a medical treatment, which is why it has no major mainstream attention.  Things need to show effectiveness against disease in human clinical trials. We don't even know if diet and exercise work better than these supplements in some regards.  Have you seen the difference in health between people who don't exercise at all and those that do?  It's ""miraculous"". 

You should check out the stickied introductory thread for videos introducing the topic of age related disease, as well as read the fightaging.org FAQ:  https://www.fightaging.org/faq to get a proper introduction rather than thinking there's a miracle supplement.   There is also the rejuvenation roadmap that shows dozens of preliminary research programs for interventions: https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/

There are also quality control problems with NMN:

I hypothesized a government offering longevity treatments in lieu of pension payments.

&gt; Aims &amp; Scope

&gt; How long will we live? And how much of that time will comprise a healthy life? What is aging, and **can we stop or even reverse the aging process**? What is the connection between aging and disease? Can we predict the evolving trends in the aging of human populations and prepare our societies for what has been called the ‘silver tsunami’? These are some of the important questions that the broad field of aging research is trying to address and that together form one of the Grand Challenges of the twenty-first century.

Absolutely huge that one of the most prestigious scientific journals is explicitly outlining the possibility of stopping or reversing the aging process as a means for intervention for age-related diseases. 

&gt; Research published in the journal includes studies on the biology of aging and longevity that aim to elucidate what aging is at a biological level and **how to harness those biological processes to prolong lifespan and healthspan.** The journal also features translational and clinical research focused on diseases that primarily affect older individuals. We particularly welcome translational research examining the connection between aging and disease in a variety of animal models; clinical research focusing on aging-associated medical conditions, including age-related cancers, metabolic syndromes, inflammaging, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders; and medical and health research specifically focusing on older people, such as studies in geriatrics and gerontology. Our interests also extend to research addressing the socioeconomic challenges and opportunities associated with global population aging and global and public health studies centered on the older strata of our societies. These include studies on the physical, mental and social well-being of older people, the demographics of aging populations and epidemiology.

The roundworms used in the study are commonly used to predict effects in human cells as their machinery is quite similar.  It was speculated that this relationship came down to improving maternal health after failed reproduction so that the mother would have further chances to reproduce.  Such a thing would be formed through natural selection, likely far back in the ancestry of multicellular organisms, so it’s probably likely that such a response could be found throughout many species of animals who share common ancestors.

Abstract:

&gt; The proteostasis network is regulated by transcellular communication to promote health and fitness in metazoans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, signals from the germline initiate the decline of proteostasis and repression of cell stress responses at reproductive maturity, indicating that commitment to reproduction is detrimental to somatic health. Here we show that proteostasis and stress resilience are also regulated by embryo-to-mother communication in reproductive adults. To identify genes that act directly in the reproductive system to regulate somatic proteostasis, we performed a tissue targeted genetic screen for germline modifiers of polyglutamine aggregation in muscle cells. We found that inhibiting the formation of the extracellular vitelline layer of the fertilized embryo inside the uterus suppresses aggregation, improves stress resilience in an HSF-1-dependent manner, and restores the heat-shock response in the somatic tissues of the parent. This pathway relies on DAF-16/FOXO activation in vulval tissues to maintain stress resilience in the mother, suggesting that the integrity of the embryo is monitored by the vulva to detect damage and initiate an organismal protective response. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed transcellular pathway that links the integrity of the developing progeny to proteostasis regulation in the parent.",1,1587619523,longevity

I suspect most people think of it as a separate entity from medicine, something that just 'happens' with time, despite being the #1 risk factor for basically every chronic disease. Having breakthrough papers published in the last ~2 decades in CNS journals where we can empirically show that aging is a causative risk factor that is amenable to intervention, such as with the Mayo Clinic senolytic data, is something that is crucial to demonstrating this.

Making these changes in the undergrad biomedical curriculum is challenging.

,shrillthrill,"Paper: [The Immune Response Against Human Cytomegalovirus Links Cellular to Systemic Senescence [2020, open-access]](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/3/766)

Abstract:

&gt; Aging reflects long-term decline in physiological function and integrity. Changes arise at a variable pace governed by time-dependent and -independent mechanisms that are themselves complex, interdependent and variable. Molecular decay produces inferior cells that eventually dominate over healthy counterparts in tissues they comprise. In a form of biological entropy, progression from molecular through cellular to tissue level degeneration culminates in organ disease or dysfunction, affecting systemic health. To better understand time-independent contributors and their potential modulation, common biophysical bases for key molecular and cellular changes underlying age-related physiological deterioration must be delineated. This review addresses the potential contribution of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven T cell proliferation to cellular senescence and immunosenescence. We first describe molecular processes imposing cell cycle arrest, the foundation of cellular senescence, then focus on the unique distribution, phenotype and function of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in the context of cellular senescence and “inflammaging”. Their features position CMV infection as a pathogenic accelerant of immune cell proliferation underlying immune senescence. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, where increased inflammation and exaggerated anti-CMV immune responses accelerate immune senescence, CMV infection has emerged as a major factor in unhealthy aging. Thus, we speculate on mechanistic links between CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell expansion, immune senescence and prevalence of age-related disorders in HIV infection.

&amp;nbsp;

FightAging.org take:

&gt; With the newfound acceptance of senescent cell accumulation as an important contributing cause of aging, a viewpoint that has really only flourished in the research community over the last five years or so, many fields of research relevant to aging are retrofitting senescent cells into their theories and understanding of the aging process. Today's open access paper is an example of this process. Researchers interested in the role of persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in the aging, a field that has itself seen a surge of interest over the past decade, link it to cellular senescence and the growth of chronic inflammation that occurs in old age.

&gt; CMV is a type of herpesvirus that is very prevalent in the population; near everyone is exposed to it at some point in time. There is good epidemiological evidence associating CMV exposure to worse health in later life. CMV provokes the adaptive immune system into specializing ever more resources to tackling it, a futile effort as it cannot be cleared from the body. It hides, latent, to emerge again. The thymus, where T cells of the adaptive immune system mature, atrophies with age, and the supply of new T cells diminishes. Without reinforcements, this continual specialization to CMV depletes the immune system of cells capable of handling other tasks.

&gt; One of those tasks is the destruction of senescent cells, rapidly enough to prevent their inflammatory secretions from disrupting tissue maintenance and organ function. The pace of clearance of senescent cells declines with age, and this is one of the contributing factors leading to an increased number of such errant cells in old tissues. Further, the pressure that CMV puts on the immune system produces other more direct issues, such as forcing a greater replication of immune cells that drives them into senescence faster than would otherwise be the case. Senescent immune cells are just as problematic as senescent cells in tissues.

**Being rational about health: the pandemic’s long-term silver lining?**

“Generals are always prepared to fight the last war.” –Winston Churchill

I  briefly  toyed  with  the  idea  of  writing  an  editorial  that  does  not  focus  on  the  current global pandemic, but, well...

Many  years  ago  I  discussed  in  this  space1a  scenario  that,  while  fanciful,  bears  some resemblance to our prevailing predicament: the evolution of HIV into a form transmissible by air, resulting in essentially everyone contracting it because of its long latency. I explored how  society  might  react,  and  contrasted  it  with  the  way  we  react  to  another  medical condition  that  I  need  not  name,  which  everyone  already  has  but  which  society  somehow does not take quite so seriously.

The  bulk  of  our  attention  presently  focuses,  quite  rightly,  on  the  near-term  priority  of overcoming Covid-19 and minimising the loss of life that it is causing. However, it is never too  soon  to  allocate  some  of  our  thoughts  and  actions  to  forward  planning:  to  ensuring that our post-crisis actions do not merely revert to the status quo ante, but are refined in such a way as to minimise the risk of similar future crises. This is, as a rule, too much to ask when  we  refer  to  society  at  large,  but  it  may  not  be  so  when  considering  actions  of governments –especially  those  actions  that  occur  behind  the  scenes.  The  most  obvious example  of  success  in  this  regard  is  the  reaction  to  9/11:  the  measures  that  have  been most  conspicuous  to  the  pubic  in  minimising  subsequent  terrorist  activity  and  those  that have been the most effective in doing so are very probably not strongly correlated.

Prevention  has  not  been  the  strong  suit  of  medical  practice  over  the  years,  despite  the public’s general acceptance in principle of the dictum that it is better than cure. In one sense this is not the medical community’s fault: in essence, it arises from society’s entirely correct  impression  that  medicine  is  not  all  that  far  removed  from  magic,  i.e.  that  medics only very approximately know what they’re doing and can easily do more harm than good, especially  with  experimental  new  treatments.  If  the  amount  of  good  that  can  be  done  is seen  as  slight,  simply  because  one  is  not  yet  sick,  the  risk/benefit  ratio  is  not  seen  as attractive.  And  the  logic  that  invalidates  that  thinking  is  quite  hard  to  communicate, relying as it does on an assessment of the “discount rate” of the importance of one’s health at greater or lesser distances into the future.

Hence the need to consider measures that do not require public action or decision-making, only  assent  (to  the  extent  that  they  are  even  public –but I won’t go there today).  One category of such measures, including the addition of fluoride to drinking water or folate to flour, does not merit much discussion in this forum, though it surely has great relevance to the  broader  issue  of  public  health.  My  focus  here,  instead,  is on  what  changes  might  be appropriate –and,  thus,  might  be  worth  advocating  for  before  decision-makers  start  to decide  that  they  already  know  what  to  do –in  the  realm  of  policies  that  are  relatively inexpensive  and  inconspicuous  but  yet  highly  impactful. Among  these,  I  would  like  to highlight  three,  though  without  in  any  way  implying  that  no  others  are  comparably important.

Firstly  and  most  obviously,  it  is  vital  to  develop  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  maximise readiness  to  respond  to  the  emergence  of  a  new  infection,  with  particular  emphasis  on those  that  are  transmissible  before  they  become  symptomatic.  As  I  write,  it  remains  the expert  consensus  that  no  vaccine  against  Covid-19  will  be  widely  available until late this year at the earliest. To take just one example: can the pipeline for developing, testing and manufacturing  monoclonal  neutralising  antibodies  be  greatly  streamlined  with  a  suitable amount of public investment? I bet it can. More generally, and I do not in any sense claim originality for this sentiment, it is an utter scandal that vaccine and antibiotic development has historically received such paltry  public  funding.  If  that  neglect  can  be  brought  to  an end, or even substantially alleviated, in the aftermath of the pandemic, that will constitute a very meaningful silver lining.

Secondly, and most directly relevant to the current public conversation: while any infection is preferentially  dangerous for those with weak immune systems, different infections require subtly different strengths –and it  seems clear, from the  statistics  that most of us are monitoring day by day, that the aspects of the immune response that are of greatest  relevance  to  Covid-19’s potency overlap greatly with those that most severely decline with age. Accordingly, there is an intense need to bring to policy-makers’ attention the immense potential for recent research advances to bear fruit as genuine rejuvenation of the immune systems of the elderly. If vaccines can be made to work even half as well in the  older  population  as  they  do  for  young  adults,  we  will  be  in  a  different  world.  Now  is the time to communicate the message that that world is truly foreseeable.

Finally,  and  fittingly  for  an  editorial  in RR,  there  is  a  more  general  message.  The  immune system is just one of the many functions of our bodies that become impaired with age, but it  is  a  particularly  pervasive  one:  immunosenescence  results  not  only  in  diminished defence against infections, but also in weakened ability to overcome incipient cancers and in  elevated  autoimmune  disease.  As  such,  if  the  current  pandemic  can  educate  decision-makers  as  to  the  need  to  invest  more  wisely  and  far-sightedly  in  medical  research  and infrastructure,  it  has  the  potential  to  extend  to  a sea  change  in  how  such  people  think about  public  health  in  general.  For  too  long,  the  pandemic  of  aging  has  been  viewed  as politically toxic, with greater concern being assigned to the economics of paying pensions than  to  the  humanitarian  imperative  to  maximise  the  health  of  all  age  groups.  From  this massive  crisis,  like  other  crises  of  the  past,  there  may  arise  an  opportunity.  Those  with influence in the corridors of power have a duty not to waste it.",11,1586939762,longevity
,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; It has been noted for quite some time that DNA methylation levels decline with age. The significance of this change remained unknown until it became possible to measure methylation status of specific sites on the DNA. It was observed that while the methylation of some sites does indeed decrease with age, that of others increase or remain unchanged. The application of machine learning methods to these quantitative changes in multiple sites, allowed the generation of a highly accurate estimator of age, called the epigenetic clock. The application of this clock on large human epidemiological data sets revealed that discordance between the predicted (epigenetic age) and chronological age is associated with many age-related pathologies, particularly when the former is greater than the latter. The epigenetic clock clearly captures to some degree, biological features that accompany the ageing process. Despite the ever-increasing scope of pathologies that are found to be associated with accelerated epigenetic ageing, the basic principles that underlie the ticking of the clock remain elusive. Here, we describe the known molecular and cellular attributes of the clock and consider their properties, and proffer opinions as to how they may be connected and what might be the underlying mechanism. Emerging from these considerations is the inescapable view that epigenetic ageing begins from very early moments after the embryonic stem cell stage and continues un-interrupted through the entire life-course. This appears to be a consequence of processes that are necessary for the development of the organism from conception and to maintain it thereafter through homeostasis. Hence, while the speed of ageing can, and is affected by external factors, the essence of the ageing process itself is an integral part of, and the consequence of the development of life.

Impact statement:

&gt; The field of epigenetic ageing is relatively new, and the speed of its expansion presents a challenge in keeping abreast with new discoveries and their implications. Several reviews have already addressed the great number of pathologies, health conditions, life-style, and external stressors that are associated with changes to the rate of epigenetic ageing. While these associations highlight and affirm the ability of epigenetic clock to capture biologically meaningful changes associated with age, they do not inform us about the underlying mechanisms. In this very early period since the development of the clock, there have been rather limited experimental research that are aimed at uncovering the mechanism. Hence, the perspective that we proffer is derived from available but nevertheless limited lines of evidence that together provide a seemingly coherent narrative that can be tested. This, we believe would be helpful towards uncovering the workings of the epigenetic clock.",1,1586859156,longevity

It doesn't do much for lifespan in mice at all.  It's a weak calorie restriction mimetic.  So if you are already not over-eating, you could be getting more benefit than it would otherwise provide.


See here for a biographical review of resveratrol, a 20 year retrospective from one of the investigators (John M. Pezzuto) of [a 1997 paper on resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8985016), which had sparked initial interest in the compound:

* [Resveratrol: Twenty Years of Growth, Development and Controversy (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30332889) (open-access)

Further fame for resveratrol came due to the work of biogerontologist [David Sinclair](http://medapps.med.harvard.edu/agingresearch/index.php/about/staff/sinclair) and colleagues, who drew attention to Resveratrol (circa 2006) as a molecule from grapes (and other plants) that may improve healthspan when isolated and supplemented.    Most of the attention revolved around whether resveratrol activated [SIRT1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin_1) (contested - see Pezzuto above, and Examine.com below), acting as a calorie restriction mimetic (as SIRT1 is activated during fasting and calorie restriction).

&gt; RSV appears to have better pro-longevity effects in some organisms compared to others as evidenced by the fact that this polyphenol is most effective for extending longevity in yeast, worms, and killifish while mice and flies are not as responsive to treatment [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27781945), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622429/)]. Although there is evidence to suggest that RSV supplementation is beneficial to improve markers of cardiometabolic health in rodents and non-human primates, the translational potential of RSV has been controversial. 

Despite failure to achieve lifespan extension in mammals, it may still offer some minor health effects that are still being actively researched.  According to a 2018 LinkedIn post, David Sinclair personally/anecdotally still takes 1g of resveratrol per day^[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advice-article-david-sinclair/), in combination with NMN.

Human trials have compared the effects of Resveratrol with Calorie Restriction on activation of SIRT1, finding serum SIRT1 increased under both:

* [Serum concentrations and gene expression of sirtuin 1 in healthy and slightly overweight subjects after caloric restriction or resveratrol supplementation: A randomized trial (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28029409)  

&gt; The study included 48 healthy subjects randomized to 30 days of RSV (500 mg/day) or CR (1000 cal/day). Waist circumference (p = 0.011), TC (p = 0.007), HDL (p = 0.031), non-HDL (p = 0.025), ApoA1 (p = 0.011), and ApoB (p = 0.037) decreased in the CR group. However, TC (p = 0.030), non-HDL (p = 0.010), ApoB (p = 0.034), and HOMA-IR (p = 0.038) increased in the RSV group. RSV and CR increased serum levels of Sirt-1, respectively, from 1.06 ± 0.71 ng/mL to 5.75 ± 2.98 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.0001) and from 1.65 ± 1.81 ng/mL to 5.80 ± 2.23 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.0001).

* [A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of resveratrol for Alzheimer disease (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362286)

&gt; Resveratrol and its major metabolites were measurable in plasma and CSF. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. CSF Aβ40 and plasma Aβ40 levels declined more in the placebo group than the resveratrol-treated group, resulting in a significant difference at week 52. Brain volume loss was increased by resveratrol treatment compared to placebo.

&gt; Volumetric MRI revealed that brain volumes (excluding CSF, brain stem, and cerebellum) declined significantly more (n = 96, P = 0.025) and ventricular volume increased more (n = 96, P = 0.05) in the resveratrol-treated group A subgroup analysis revealed that brain volume declined more with treatment in the APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. These findings persisted when participants with weight loss were excluded. The interpretation of greater brain volume loss with resveratrol treatment is unclear, but this finding was not associated with greater cognitive or functional decline. In fact, less decline (a clinical benefit) with treatment was detected in a functional measure—the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL).

The authors of the study offered the following comment:

&gt; “We’re not sure how to interpret this finding. A similar decrease in brain volume was found with some anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials,” Turner adds. A working hypothesis is that the treatments may reduce inflammation (or brain swelling) found with Alzheimer’s.

Abstract:

&gt; Urolithin A (UA) is a natural dietary, microflora-derived metabolite shown to stimulate mitophagy and improve muscle health in old animals and in preclinical models of aging1. Here, we report the results of a first-in-human clinical trial in which we administered UA, either as a single dose or as multiple doses over a 4-week period, to healthy, sedentary elderly individuals.  
We show that UA has a favourable safety profile (primary outcome). UA was bioavailable in plasma at all doses tested, and 4 weeks of treatment with UA at doses of 500 mg and 1,000 mg modulated plasma acylcarnitines and skeletal muscle mitochondrial gene expression in elderly individuals (secondary outcomes). These observed effects on mitochondrial biomarkers show that UA induces a molecular signature of improved mitochondrial and cellular health following regular oral consumption in humans.",1,1586299271,longevity

,shrillthrill,"&gt; Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is uncommon in cells but forms during the replication of certain viral genomes, and is thought to provide the ligand activating ZBP1 during viral infection. The scientists hypothesized that cellular dsRNA could be produced by endogenous retroelements, which are forms of parasitic DNA derived either from ancient retroviral infections or from active retrotransposons or ‘jumping genes’, which constitute over half of the human and mouse genomes. To address the possible role of endogenous retroelements as sources of dsRNA, the team of Manolis Pasparakis collaborated with George Kassiotis’ Retroviral Immunology Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute. Indeed, computational analysis of RNA sequencing data from mouse skin showed that most complementary, putatively double-stranded, RNA was derived from particular groups of endogenous retroelements.

&gt; These findings suggested that sensing of cellular dsRNA, most likely derived from endogenous retroelements, activates ZBP1, inducing cell death and inflammation. This mechanism may be relevant for the pathogenesis of inflammatory pathologies in humans, particularly in patients with mutations of proteins inhibiting ZBP1 such as RIPK1.
‘Z-form nucleic acids have remained mysterious for so many years’, Pasparakis remarked. ‘Currently, our only means to investigate their function is by studying the proteins that sense them. We made some progress, but the challenge ahead would be to understand why, where and how they form within a cell and what the purpose of this is.’

&gt; A particularly fascinating aspect is the link to endogenous retroelements. ‘We currently understand very little about how these genomic parasites affect our health. It appears that over the course of evolution, some retrotransposons, which can mimic viral infection, have been recruited as useful partners in the response of our cells to damage, stress or true infection, but this partnership can also go wrong, causing disease’, Kassiotis commented.

&gt; ‘Just like during viral infection, sensing of Z-RNA produced by endogenous retroelements by ZBP1 could provide a potent trigger for cell death and inflammation, and cause disease. These are early days and we have a long way to go, but understanding the underlying mechanisms may one day lead to novel therapies for human diseases’, Pasparakis concluded.",1,1585806086,longevity
,Joram2,"&gt; But they have public systems in place to advocate for the customer to prevent $400 a month insulin (which by the way, the creator gave away for free to humanity but it got patented and slightly reformulated by pharma).

Regarding overpriced insulin in the US, slatestarcodex explains that in part II of this long blog post:
https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/30/buspirone-shortage-in-healthcaristan-ssr/

SSC is a practicing MD psychiatrist who writes under a pen name. I hope you read the whole thing, but in case you don't, I'd like to briefly summarize. First an excerpt:

&gt; The price of insulin is much too high. Vox argues that this is because of the “lax regulatory environment” and the “free market approach”, and that if we could just become socialist like all of the cool countries, everything would be fine.

That's basically your stance. SSC makes the opposite conclusion: The insulin sold in the US is brand name. Many other poorer countries such as Peru have cheaper generic insulin, because they have less regulation designed to drive away cheap generics and enable brand name pharmaceuticals to charge premium pricing. The US has more regulation and has successfully chased out generic insulin makers from the US market.

The fact that you had to ask that and weren't aware suggests you are good at tuning out mistakes by media outlets on your team, and taking extra notice of mistakes made by your chosen rivals.

&gt; Part of the problem with getting the public on board with the scientific consensus is that by teaching 6,000 year old intelligent design (as in Kansas and lets be honest, red states), it delegitimizes science in the eyes of citizens.

I don't find this convincing. Science has to persuade people. And it does...

I find evolution a pretty basic piece of biology... In my college, there is a two-semester basic biology sequence two accompanying labs. You study the beginnings of life, then move to early pre-life cell structures, then bacteria, then amoebas, other multi-celled microbes, actually look at algae under a microscope, then plants, then dissect a living worm, then move up to birds, frogs, and mammals, and dissect eyes, hearts, brains. You can see the evolution of each piece of animals. I felt it would be impossible to get through such a class without intuitively understanding evolution.

But I think of the Amish or the US underclass (many taught in ultra-Democratic districts), and they just basically don't deal with abstract science like that at all. Out of all the problems i see in the world, teaching these guys basic biology doesn't seem terribly important. I guess the Amish are reasonably happy, good for them. I know some people from the US underclass, I'd rather help them avoid major life traumas than learn basic biology they won't ever use.",1,1585801285,longevity
,Joram2,"&gt; But we knew about this for months and Trump as well as the GOP downplayed this big time in February,

Some of this criticism is valid. And I partly agree. However, many left-wing leaders and news outlets also downplayed the virus in Jan/Feb or simply ignored it.

Bill Gates gets the most credit for warning us years ago about a deadly virus.

Senator Tom Cotton also gets credit for loudly sounding the alarm in January.

And Trump, while Trump did downplay the virus in February and even early March, he also listened to critics and imposed important travel restrictions with China in January, long before the mainstream elite caught on.

&gt; The Bible says the world is 6,000 years old; its not. The Bible says evolution isn't real; it is.

The evolution argument is really silly. I believe in evolution. But realistically the majority of humans on Earth simply don't care about deep science like that. If you could see into the mind of the average shopper at a Walmart in the developed world, they probably don't know much about biology, or how transistors work, or how to derive the Heine-Borel Theorem... Even most public K-12 school administrators I know probably don't know what I consider very rudimentary grade school level math.

Even the crusty Vatican has formally believed in evolution for decades. And mainline Protestant groups like the Episcopalians have generally believed in evolution for many decades earlier, some since the days of Darwin.

There are many Christians that don't believe in evolution, such as the Amish Christians; and that's one of the least crazy beliefs they have. But who cares? I have no desire to debate the Amish on biology. I don't look to them for the latest in technology. They are generally pleasant neighbors, they generally don't commit much crime on outsiders, and they are generally self-sufficient people.

&gt; Church attendance is declining for a number of reasons and its not going back to the 1950s ever, no matter what Trump says or does.

One big factor is the religious people have lots of children, while non-religious people have very few. In history, many completely intelligent rational factions of humans just faded away with low birth rates, while religious populations exploded in size. The people alive today descend from the latter, high birth rate religious populations. It's possible that the existing population of places like the US and Europe secularize, stop going to church, and also have very few children and basically fade away, while highly religious populations explode. I have no idea how this will play out in the future; except I expect drastic changes to everything. Basic birth control technology changed society in the past. Technology changes have accelerated and will change society in many more ways that we won't fully predict.

&gt; As far as Obama's religion, if he says he's religious I have no reason to doubt the man's personal convictions.

That is rather credulous. I can't prove what he really thinks, but it seems quite believable that a career politician would choose a position on such a political issue for political reasons.

&gt; The Bible itself says there's no sins of the father, whereas Trump himself has three wives and he is the president in question.

I do think that's reasonable secular morality that we don't blame the child for the sins of the father or mother.

Trump doesn't presently have three wives, Trup has had three wives in the past and present in serial monogomous fashion. He didn't have simultaneous plural wives. That's a big difference. He also hasn't had children out of wedlock, or not provided for the children he did sire, which is a big moral issue.

&gt; There are an abundance of studies from epidemiologists and public health experts, economists etc... suggesting that a M4A would actually save billions of dollars by providing preventative care... companies.

Every side of this argument has an ""abundance of studies"" to back them up. I find this argument highly unbelievable. Most health care spending occurs at the end of life, which is unfortunate, and at some level, end of life health issues aren't preventable with existing treatments.

&gt; ...and by stopping the gravy train to insurance and pharma

ok, I'm all for stopping the gravy train of government handouts to pretty much everything... including to academia. I'm sympathetic to foreign policy arguments, although I know you would (correctly) say that the military is just a giant gravy train.

&gt; I'm in higher ed as a graduate student

Grad students have it hard. They make very little money, it's hard work. I've heard they have high rates of depression and anxiety. That doesn't sound fun. At the same time, I'm envious. They often get to do work that is more interesting than what normal people have to do, and it's often higher status in many senses than normal jobs that adults are expected to do to earn a living.

Ultimately, while academia exists as a government funded entity, I think every US citizen should have more full access to it. I don't believe they have the right to have an exlusion admissions sytem when they are running on the public's dime.

&gt; I'm unnerved at the fact that academics and research are continually undermined and discredited in favor of guys literally caught haggling over a monthly salary to write op-eds for Big Tobacco.

,MarkOrangey234,"&lt;blockquote&gt; There are lots of dumb, or even mean arguments from both sides, including my side, which I'm presently cheering for the Republican side. There are nuggets of truth there: I'd say Obama is a secular or non-religious person. The difference between atheist and secular is arguably a minor difference.  Later Obama claims to have converted into a true believing Christian, but that seems like a transparently political move. Trump was a playboy real estate developer, and it makes him less believable when he makes serious pronouncements about God and religious faith.

I have Democratic friends, who say, they think that paranoid Christians are basically correct: The Democrats are trying to undermine and demote the power and authority and position of the Church and Christianity, and they see that as a good thing. Trump may not be an authentic Christian himself, but in the political culture war, he's fought to raise the status of Christianity. With the recent virus, Trump said he hoped to restart or ""resurrect"" the economy by ""Easter"", which was a very deliberate Christian reference.
What disturbed me about Obama's religious views, was not his lack of genuine faith, it was that he went to a church founded on ""black liberation theology"", which was filled with black power and legitimate racial animosity towards white people. Obama had a very close relationship with Jeremiah Wright, which I feel was legitimately offensive. &lt;blockquote&gt;
I'm not sure the democrats are trying to ""demote"" Christianity or anything but its difficult since many Christians don't seem to be able to accommodate/tolerate different religions or science or LGBT rights. More democrats are christian than secular but I can't even tell what Christians believe other than they are one. The Bible says the world is 6,000 years old; its not. The Bible says evolution isn't real; it is. Bible says two of each species boarded a ship for a giant flood; thought experiment, try doing some basic napkin math on that for how big it would have to be. Not in vogue with ecologists... The Bible says gay people are condemned to death, despite evidence that praying away the gay doesn't work and its largely a fixed orientation (just like praying away a hurricane or anything else doesn't work) but it also says if your son comes home drunk you should stone him to death but a number of the homophobic Wisconsinites I know don't seem to care about God's opinion on this issue at all. The Bible says the Rich can't go to heaven but there is this incredible hero worship of money interests and wealth (see Donald Trump) and the self-proclaimed entrepreneur by conservatives. I don't know what they believe other than what they cherry pick for however they feel at the moment from God's word. Team Christian faithfully serving, supporting and donating to monied interests since, forever. But thats me as an athiest not as a democrat.      
 Church attendance is declining for a number of reasons and its not going back to the 1950s ever, no matter what Trump says or does. Part of that is a simple function of people having more stuff to do/alternative communities to join. I can see church being in some cases a comforting, civic institution in an otherwise isolating world so I do see how that could be disconcerting to many. Good or bad though, its happening and shows no signs of stopping. Candidly, I think if God were to actually make any kind of appearance in anything other than improbable football games and dreams, it would make a strong and immediate return. Not holding my breath... Its not an agenda to snuff out Christianity, my mom is a bible school teacher, but people who identify strongly with some tribe or ""Team Christian"" are probably feeling anxiety as they see religion in general waning in importance. The Constitution clearly enumerates freedom of religion as well as the separation of church and state yet when it comes to taking down the ten commandments in front of southern capitol buildings, where it shouldn't be as the government shouldn't acknowledge one religion over another, the constitutionalist right never seems to extend their constitutional sensibilities to it. It almost like so-called Christians only want freedom of religion when ITS their religion/perceived hegemony. 

As far as Obama's religion, if he says he's religious I have no reason to doubt the man's personal convictions. Furthermore, the country has an atrious and ongoing history of enslaving, exploiting and abusing the African-American community, with preachers often traditionally the only permitted avenue for social movements. A preacher who talks about the emancipation of black people in America and condemns the awful treatment of that community is probably fully justified and fighting the good fight, our treatment of that community is an ongoing blight and enduring shame on the nation. People said the same stuff about Dr. Martin Luther King as being too radical and disruptive.  

&lt;blockquote&gt; Also, ""Obama's baby mama racism had he had kids by three different wives"", Worse, is he apparently still was actively married to his first wife Kezia Aoko who was raising his kids back in Africa when he impregnated and later briefly married 17 year old white girl Ann Dunham. &lt;blockquote&gt; I'm not sure about his father but the issue isn't Obama's father. That's not an extension of Obama though (not to say three different wives is inherently bad). The Bible itself says there's no sins of the father, whereas Trump himself has three wives and he is the president in question. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; At risk of this conversation taking too many tangents. I strongly disagree. But ultimately, the middle class is going to have to pay for health care, one way or another. Americans would be better off if they paid for health care directly, and they have more autonomy about the service that they receive, rather than the government stepping in, taking giant sums of money that ultimately come from regular Americans, and buy health care services for Americans in a grossly inefficient fashion.
M4A may be the norm in Europe and Canada, but it's not a good norm. The US has led the world in free market innovation; we should do it in healthcare &lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is a strong argument to be made that in one of the wealthiest countries (as a function of population, arable land, resources) there is a moral and ethical imperative to provide basic care for the most needy as the bare minimum. Another aircraft launcher, to paraphrase Eisenhower, is ultimately a theft from what could otherwise be used to feed or house those of us in need. 
So even if it costs money, there is a case that as a nation that spends a wasteful and egregious amount on military spending that is certainly overboard and feeds into the military industrial complex, there is a responsibility to ensure that at least people aren't dying because they can't afford a $90 teeth cleaning that eventually becomes an infection. 
But its not even just an issue of values, its actually more economically sound to provide M4A. And by a lot. 
There are an abundance of studies from epidemiologists and public health experts, economists etc... suggesting that a M4A would actually save billions of dollars by providing preventative care and by stopping the gravy train to insurance and pharma companies. Even the conservative Mercador study, funded by Rupert fucking Murdoch, found net savings for comparable quality of care.  
I keep hearing it repeated that competition drives down prices, increases business efficiency but we pay twice as much per capita on healthcare as Canada and more of our GDP percentage-wise, with Canada being healthier and longer-lived. Kinda sounds like more for less and a talking point crafted by the collective ""competition"".
I'm not sure the even US leads in terms of innovation per capita, in gross it probably does since it has 330 million people in a mostly developed nation. The EU is a better comparison (though hard to compare with population differences)

I don't know about the alleged rape but ultimately Clinton didn't run on supposed morality or family values. My point is that you have evangelical groups endorsing Trump, calling Dems godless and amoral (not that this is a problem; I don't believe in God) who would be screeching had Obama conducted himself in the same way or god forbid the thinly veiled Obama's baby mama racism had he had kids by three different wives. I've heard he's a gay Muslim atheist Kenyan and Michelle is transsexual (not that any of those things are inherently wrong) numerous times, can't imagine how it would play out with Trump's conduct. 
Yeah these guys like Scruton and Buckley always seem to be aligned at the end of the day with prevailing corporate interests and power structures. I think the tobacco thing is most instructive because it represents an attack on scientific consensus and a disinformation campaign to discredit it in order to prolong the cash flow for a certain industry.
And absolutely not. Republicans tend to be worse about it, particularly with issues involving the militarization of the police and police brutality, but neoliberals aren't much better than neoconservatives on this issue. Clinton is on record making the infamous ""super predator"" comment, which, even 20 years ago, stinks of racial undertones. That's because neoliberals in the United States again would be conservative in almost any other democratic, industrialized nation. Trump supported the Iraq War (and lied about supporting it after the fact, despite recordings of him supporting it) but yeah, fuck Biden and the Clintons (and even fuck Obama to some extent). Biden doesn't even support marijuana legalization, which is beyond 50% support for the general population and really not in line with the rest of the party. 

By experts I primarily focus on scientists and experts. Having adults in the room or on a council is one thing but when the people leaving your administration routinely say that the president doesn't listen to or care what they say, what's the use? Betsy Devos isn't qualified for her education post, except being a billionaire who got sued for her for-profit Corinthian Colleges (as did Trump for Trump University) that targeted first-generation and poor high school seniors and either is the secretary of energy (Rick Perry has no scientific qualifications at all and didn't really know what the DOE was until getting appointed). Contrast that with Obama's DOE heads, with a Phd from Berkeley and an accomplished researcher, Steven Chu and Moniz with a degree in theoretical physics.
Or Scott Pruitt (EPA) and Andrew Wheeler (EPA), neither of which have any pertinent qualifications either, except literally being coal lobbyists, which is the most bald-faced attempt for Trump to gut environmental protections possible and are reported to be censoring and gagging scientists at those agencies.
The ""expert"" economists you mentioned is in a notoriously partisan field and is not really in the same category as the others; economics. Furthermore, all three are basically just pro-cutting taxes on the wealthy, with Kudlow basically being from Wall Street, Laffer having interest in  and Stephen Moore not even a real economist, just a writer and an ""economist"" for the notoriously pro-corporate interest Heritage think tank. Again its hard to trust these guys to do anything that doesn't benefit corporate interests or the wealthy.    

As far as exercise goes, I actually don't care if he exercises or not. I think exercise, especially as a longevity enthusiast, has one of the best ROIs for lifestyle practices (immune system, longevity, senescent cell clearance, insulin resistance, mental health, fitness, cardiovascular, looking good, feeling confident etc... i.e we're meant to do it) but if you don't want to do it that's ultimately your choice. I DO take HUGE exception to his rationale and justification for this practice that the human body is a battery and how he doesn't want to run out of energy. That's some blood-letting, bathing is bad, balance the humours seventeenth century shit completely out of line with the experts. Its just wrong, which is my main objection, he keeps peddling falsehoods and lies for however he feels, stuff that is flagrantly checkable and factually incorrect. 

I'm not defending WHO on a technicality, what I'm saying is WHO reports the information it receives from respective authorities. The number of cases is almost certainly a lie from the Chinese authorities but the transmissibility study may have just legitimately been the lack of conclusive evidence. But that doesn't make it complicit or mean its endorsing that view by reporting it at first. If it doesn't change its stance once those reports start becoming incredible or flags start then you might say that its failing its job. Plus unfortunately if they are too critical of the Chinese government after the fact, then we get zero cooperation in terms of worldwide vaccination efforts or HIV prevention, 1.3 billion is a large chunk of humanity.

And lmao you don't need to convince me China is doing all sorts of unscrupulously lying about, well, everything. There are functional concentration camps in Xinjiang, they are a straight up repressive authoritarian regime. They also, for a country that pays lip service to the people, provide even less of a social safety set or worker protections than we do. There is this idea that criticizing the United States and exploitation here somehow means selectively ignoring environmental, political or social situations in China. Thats not true, I've never met anyone on the left who, except along a handful of dimensions like robust EV research, support the CCP in the slightest. Its just that its easy for people like Trump to talk about China Flu and go back to the playbook of attacking some foreign other when faced with legitimate criticism of his domestic response. It feels really good in a tribal sense to point fingers and deflect and I understand the discomfort his supporters often have being self-critical.",1,1585452155,longevity
,ScienceDawns,"If it was just Papua New Guinea I would agree. But the UAE, Qatar and other countries with such low Alzheimer's such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman have good health care systems and statistics agencies. So their rates are extremely unlikely to be flukes.

And in the Western world there are also large differences. Although not order-of-magnitude differences the age adjusted Alzheimer's rate in Ireland is three times lower than in Finland.

India and Sub-Saharan Africa also have low rates. But of course like Papua New Guinea their healthcare and statistics services are generally poor. So their rates could also be explained by bad statistics or bad diagnosis. If that is true we would expect to see similar rates of disease in a study where one actually goes to look at patients. Which is exactly what [Hendrie et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7573588) did. According to them the age standardized Alzheimer's rates are two and a half times lower in Nigeria compared to African Americans in Indianapolis using the same methodology for detection. Similar results for other types of dementia. This is only one study of course and we certainly don't have a lot of evidence because Sub-Saharan Africa is so understudied. But it is interesting since these populations are genetically very similar.

Ideally we would look at autopsies instead of live patients. Because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish Alzheimer's dementia from other types of dementia. And because people may have had Alzheimer's but died from some other illness. Unfortunately to my knowledge this has never been done for Alzheimer's dementia. We do however have an [old study](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0002-9149(60)90007-2) of ischemic attacks (heart attacks, lung embolisms, deep vein thrombosis, etc.). This study looked at age matched populations in Uganda and African American and European American populations in St. Louis. And for heart disease too we see order-of-magnitude differences in age standardized rates. This is also shown in the reported national statistics. So large disease rate differences aren't that rare.

So in summary, we have good reported statistical evidence from the Persian Gulf states and other developed countries. Some weak reported statistical evidence from developing countries. As well as a good age matched epidemiological study and some old circumstantial evidence from autopsies from similar diseases. All in all, not the strongest evidence ever for cross country comparisons. There is much more evidence out there if you compare groups within countries, and look at randomized controlled trials of course.",1,1585433207,longevity
,Joram2,"The Stormy Daniels incident you mention happened in 2006, long before Trump entered politics and sought public office. Trump was a playboy celebrity real estate developer and paid an adult sex worker for sex. Bill Clinton was the sitting president in the actual White House, when he used his authority to have sex with Lewinsky who was working as a white house intern. Next, Clinton was credibly accused of actually rape, not statutory rape, but rape rape by Juanita Broaddrick. Next, the whole Democratic party fully committed to the lie that Clinton didn't have sex with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton gave a press conference, wagged his finger, and enunciated, ""I did not. Have. Sexual. Relations. With that woman. Ms. Lewinsky."" The Democratic Party had teams of lawyers working to paint Lewinsky as a liar and an opportunist. The Democratic Party were fully committed to that lie, until Lewsinksy produced the semen-stained dress, and they had no choice but to confess. Trump lied too But I don't think he ever even seriously tried to convince people that he really never had sex with Stormy Daniels and even his supporters believe he did.

On Roger Scruton: well those are two good points. They lower my view of Scruton. I honestly, didn't know Scruton that well, I hadn't heard those points before. As for Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, and Lindsay Graham; none of those are my personal favorite, I don't know any of them that well.

On Trump's opposition to physical exercise: that's his personal choice, and he mentions it in interviews, but that's not something he's made into a advcocacy platform. Trump has amazing stamina, especially for someone over 70, and for his lifestyle, I think his personal routine works for him. Personally, I frequent the gym.

As for distracting from the ""adults in the room making hard decisions"". Politics has always been a circus; that doesn't stop serious thinkers from doing their work. Trump has lots of serious policy experts, who have traditionally adult personality and demeanor. Larry Kudlow and Art Laffer and Stephen Moore are all serious accomplished economists on the Trump Administration.

As for your criticism of the military: that's a complicated subject. I don't completely disagree with what you write. Also, that issue isn't split on party lines. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have very hawkish records, far more big military than Trump. Joe Biden didn't merely vote for the 2003 Iraq War, he was one of the leading champions for that war.

Circling back to the WHO point: What a good health advocacy group should have done was ring the alarm bells early and as loudly as possible. If you're defending the WHO like a lawyer, you're right, quoting Chinese authorities isn't a lie at all. We shouldn't want a WHO-type group that has the best lawyers and can deflect responsibility the best. We should want a group that can help advise the world the best.

The WHO was trying to save China its embarrassment. And still, China wouldn’t cooperate transparently with the WHO.

Ignoring credible warnings from doctors, isn't lying; it's deceptive. Credulously citing stats from Beijing isn't a lie, but it's deceptive and deliberately so.

It is established that elders have a much greater risk of dying from COVID-19 than young people. The fragility of old people could not explain this phenomenon, since for young children the death risk is very low.

&gt;Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.


&gt;Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.


&gt;The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.


&gt;To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.


&gt;To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.


&gt;Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.


&gt;In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found 332 human proteins targeted by the coronavirus.


&gt;Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.


&gt;The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified 24 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat such seemingly unrelated diseases as cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension.


&gt;On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.


&gt;The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.


&gt;And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.


&gt;One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.


&gt;Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.


&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.


&gt;Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.


&gt;On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a trial on chloroquine, among other drugs.


&gt;And on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that the state had obtained large amount of chloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to start its own drug trial.


&gt;Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the new study, warned that chloroquine might have many toxic side effects, because the drug appears to target many human cellular proteins.


&gt;“You need to be careful,” he said. “We need more data at every level.”


&gt;Dr. Krogan’s collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Pasteur Institute in Paris have started testing 22 of the other compounds on the list against live coronavirus grown in their laboratories.

For those curious about what metformin does for mouse lifespan, the NIA's ITP lifespan curves for metformin are here:  https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Met/C2011 - some say this is not very impressive, and the effect is likely to be even less in humans, if at all.

Is metformin a type of exercise mimetic?  How much of metformin's benefit could be achieved by lifestyle interventions such as exercise?  Both overlap in activating the [Nrf2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770706) and [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase#Exercise/training) cellular pathways.

[Taming expectations of metformin as a treatment to extend healthspan (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746605)

&gt; The anti-hyperglycemic medication metformin has potential to be the first drug tested to slow aging in humans. While the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) proposal and other small-scale clinical trials have the potential to support aging as a treatment indication, we propose that the goals of the TAME trial might not be entirely consistent with the Geroscience goal of extending healthspan. There is expanding epidemiological support for the health benefits of metformin in individuals already diagnosed with overt chronic disease. However, it remains to be understood if these protective effects extend to those free of chronic disease. Within this editorial, we seek to highlight critical gaps in knowledge that should be considered when testing metformin as a treatment to target aging.

Some have asked whether berberine can be taken instead:  No.    Metformin has been put through studies on lifespan in mice as shown above, but the same is exactly not true for berberine.   For example: Diabetics or pre-diabetics might use berberine and see some improvement in management of their condition, but that is not evidence for longevity claims.   

While some suggest that berberine overlaps with metformin because it activates [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase), many things do this, but due to the concepts of [on-target and off-target effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23085982) (drugs doing too much of a good thing or unrelated things), berberine could have unique effects that may be detrimental to overall lifespan.  This is why studies are needed to validate the compound in mammals, such as in the [NIA's ITP](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-program-itp).  To date, one limited study on lifespan exists for berberine:

* [Berberine ameliorates cellular senescence and extends the lifespan of mice via regulating p16 and cyclin protein expression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13060)  

&gt; A complication of this study is that mice we used have a median lifespan around 600 days for both 18M and 22M groups. It is 100–200 days shorter than that from other laboratories. For the 22M group, half of the whole group has been dead when we took over; thus, the difference comes from the strain itself rather than our treatment. Since these mice may be considered to be short‐lived mice with unknown inducer, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that BBR just corrects it.

Younger people seem to have little to worry about but the elderly are being particularly hard hit.  We’d have an easier time helping these people to remain in social isolation to keep them from getting sick than we will trying to treat them all.  I think the current global strategy is to push the peak of spread to the summer months in the hope that health care systems will be better suited for the surge in hospitalizations.  A lot of people don’t realize the flu made its rounds through the country and hospitalized over 300,000 people while killing over 20,000 just several months ago.

I’ve heard some estimates that total infections could be ten times higher than reported cases, perhaps even more.

,Gohron,"Similar containment measures were initially taken when H1N1 was first identified in 2009, with a similarly morbid media depiction.  Despite extensive efforts to stop the spread of the virus (fueled by the media depicting an apocalypse in Mexico City), it had deeply penetrated into global populations in only two months, with millions of infections, eventually infecting between 700 million and 1.4 billion people.  Covid-19 does appear to be quite contagious but nowhere near as much so as influenza.  This year’s flu infected 34 million or more Americans from late October to February, basically the amount of time that Covid-19 has likely been “in the wild”.  If Covid-19 was as infectious, it likely would’ve had a strong foothold in global populations by the time it was even identified and would’ve mostly made its way through global populations by now.  The containment measures are probably lowering transmission rates a bit but all of this took a lot of time to coordinate and in that amount of time an influenza pandemic would’ve already spread through most populations.

Influenza is a serious illness, one that kills hundreds of thousands to millions just about every year.  It is exceptionally contagious, able to spread through the majority of global populations in less than 6 months, and certain strains can be much more fatal than others.  The H1N1 pandemic of 1918/19 killed between 1-6% of the total global population.  Covid-19 has not spread at that level.  It appears to be particularly serious for older people but not so much for younger people.  Fatality rates are offset when you take unreported cases into account (which global health organizations have said could be ten times higher than reported figures) and children do not appear to develop notable disease.  

The economic impact of everything going on will be extremely severe and will result in extensive human suffering dragged out over the time that comes after when we try to return to the status quo.  We have put ourselves on a path that we cannot go back from and essentially permanently changed the world and society.  While I’m sure there will be a general return to normality once this outbreak draws to an end, there’s a lot that’s going to be different.  The outbreak will be an event of major historical significance to future generations.  The panic driven response just doesn’t seem appropriate to me.

I haven’t followed up on them but I know this has made its way through some pediatric wards/hospitals (where there would be children in all different states of health) and the mortality rate remains essentially negligent.

I think your daughter should certainly take extra precautions but her age group does not seem to generate much of a response to the virus.  It’s possible she could contract it and show little to no symptoms with the pathogen taking a longer time to clear her system because of her immunodeficient status.  One thing to take into account when seeing the mortality rates for people with preexisting health conditions is that the very large majority are still elderly but this is not expressed when you just see the straight mortality rate of people with a particular condition.  It’s common for the elderly to have other health conditions like diabetes and coronary heart disease so nearly all fatal cases remain in older age groups.

,Gohron,"A lot of people aren’t taking this into account.  The major health organizations have been saying they believe actual infection rates to be much higher (I believe as high as ten times) but going unreported because they’re resulting in either no illness or one that is mild and doesn’t make the infected suspect they have anything worth worrying about.  The rise in mortality rates for the elderly is particularly concerning but we have the ability to isolate elderly populations in the developed world with all of the technology we have.  This rise in mortality rates for the elderly is also common with many other illnesses.

This virus does not appear as infectious as the flu (similar containment methods were taken against H1N1 in 2009 and the situation spiraled out of control across the entire globe in two months time from when the outbreak was first identified) but health organizations are thinking this could makes its way through a good deal of the population.  It could take many more months before all of the outbreaks are contained and new infections drop to negligible levels.  The economic impact of all the safety measures will result in far more human suffering than the virus itself will cause.

,Gohron,"Exactly what data contradicts any of what I said?  The causality you speak of is only relevant in certain health systems, as Covid-19 has reached developing nations with a health system that will be unable to handle the strain.  As far as the number of unreported cases, that’s taken directly out of BBC World News articles quoting health officials.  

The H1N1 outbreak that started in 2009 was met with similar “end of days” grimness from the media.  There were images from Mexico City all over the news, depicting scenes of apocalyptical nature.  There were serious efforts to contain that as well, with Mexico going on lockdown and significant efforts being made globally to screen travelers and quarantine and isolation of infected individuals.  This started in April of 2009 but despite containment efforts, it quickly spread around the world and the WHO and US CDC stopped counting cases in June because of how large the spread had become.  Covid-19 started to spread possibly as early as November but likely in December.  In the amount of time it has taken the world to respond to Covid-19 and prepare for it spreading and causing outbreaks, 2009 H1N1 had already deeply penetrated into it populations all over the world, eventually infecting between 700 million to 1.4 billion people.  Containment efforts were not as significant as with Covid-19 but as I said, the time it has taken the global community to mobilize efforts against Covid-19 was the time it took 2009 H1N1 to infect a significant portion of the world and it was too late for further containment efforts.

There is absolutely no published evidence that shows Covid-19 is anywhere near as infectious as influenza.  We already have reports of outbreaks in my area and the government has shut down all schools but the restaurant I work in was still open tonight and the supermarket this morning was absolutely mobbed.  Our ability to fight modern outbreaks lies mostly in our technological knowhow when it comes to medicine.  Containment efforts are adequate for stopping the spread of something like Ebola, which has more limited transmission vectors, is easy to spot, and immobilizes those infected but these efforts can only slow a walking pathogen like influenza or Covid-19 down.  There are plenty of people out there right now who are infected with it but are going about their business because they think they only have a cold.  Taking into account unreported cases (as suggested by global and national health organizations)also puts a significant dent in the mortality rate, being impossible to accurately represent but certainly being much lower than what’s derived from reported cases alone.  The growth in reported cases has not risen exponentially, despite popping up in other areas around the world who were not initially prepared.  

The economic cost of shutting down commerce in entire regions while stunting global trade will be significant.  This will be felt by people all over the world but will have especially harsh effects on the populations of developing nations.  More people will suffer as a result of the blowback from the global response than will likely suffer from the virus itself.  Every action we take against the spread of something it’s doubtful we can really even control has a consequence somewhere in the complicated web of society.  I don’t think it should be written off as something to just not worry about, but standard public precautions taken during flu season would be adequate.  The younger of us (under 50) appear to have little to worry about, even if we do get sick.  The elderly do have something to be seriously concerned about but that is the case with many things for the elderly and it would be wise for accommodations to be made for them to limit potential exposure.",1,1584341289,longevity

In the words of Danny Glover's character ""Murtaugh"" in the Lethal Weapon movies: ""I'm getting too old for this shit"". Having no money sucks balls, I feel like I lost years of my life to sickness and even with the sadness of life sometimes (I consider myself somewhat of a melancholic person), it's still too good, amazing, and interesting to give up. I want to be able to run and bike and play again without pulling a hamstring and limping around for a month because my body doesn't heal as well, etc. Etc. Explore the world without constant pain (hurting back, knees, whatever).

Still feel in my 20s in my mind though. I was just talking to my 70 year old grandma and she basically said the same thing to me. It was sad.

,BenZealley,"(Posting this on behalf of Aubrey's research assistant Michael Rae, who does not use Reddit.)

You highlight a very important issue. The traditional way that biogerontology has thought about intervention in degenerative aging (when it has thought about it at all) has been to tease apart the metabolic origins of the cellular and molecular damage that underlies aging, and then modulate those pathways in youth to make them less damaging, so that less damage is caused and we accumulate less over time, leading to slower aging.

There are several problems with this approach, one of which is the one you highlight: because they rely on reducing the *rate* at which biomolecules become damaged by the metabolic processes contributing to aging, they can only *retard* the rate of aging, not arrest or reverse it; this limits their effectiveness, particularly in people older than middle age, in whom significant aging damage has already accumulated.

Instead, the ""damage-repair"" heuristic, originally pioneered by SENS Research Foundation CSO de Grey and that we are pursuing at SENS Research Foundation, focuses on  what is truly different in a body that is actually already old, which is exactly this accumulated burden of damage to its molecular and cellular structures. Our approach is to develop ""rejuvenation biotechnologies"" that directly remove, repair, replace, or render harmless the cellular and molecular damage wrought in our tissues by the biological aging process.  It is this damage that slowly impairs the tissues of our bodies as it accumulates over time, resulting in the progressive rise in frailty, disease, disability, and death that people now suffer with age.

By clearing out that damage from the tissues, functionality can be restored and youthful health and vigor with it. By restoring the body to a state that is structurally and functionally young, its metabolic derangements will in turn be corrected as downstream consequences of the intrinsic order of the youthful body. With this return to normal functionality at every level will come restored youth, health, vigor, and vitality.

An essay on this subject is archived on the SENS Research Foundation website here:

Restoring cells to a more youthful state (in fact, replacing old cells with pristine new ones) is just one of the seven categories of damage-repair that our strategy addresses. Some info on the specific molecular targets for SENS biotechnology is presented here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20180903160231/http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research

Since the time of that post, we've become aware of an exciting new rejuvenation biotechnology in preclinical development, specific to medial elastocalcinosis (which is the most challenging and probably the most medically important form of arterial calcification):

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39639-8

Osteophytes on the bones are subject to some of the same considerations as arterial calcification above, but may be additionally aided by new surgical and graft options.

Amyloidosis within organs is, you will note, one of the seven classes of cellular and molecular damage targeted by the SENS strategy, using immunotherapy to directly remove it from tissues. See the link in the table above. The Foundation funded research to develop one such therapy, which would eventually remove amyloids composed of wild-type transthyretin from tissues: this is responsible for senile cardiac amyloidosis, as well as a significant contribution to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and (it appears) spinal stenosis as well:

https://www.jbc.org/content/289/19/13243

Several studies in animal models have shown that fibrosis within organs — whether from primary aging or from models of age-related fibrotic disease — can be substantially reversed through ablation of senescent cells with ""senolytic"" drugs or model gene therapies:

Senescent cells are an example of the ""death-resistant cell"" class of aging damage.

,Peteostro,"Don’t have a link read something a few months ago. But this article touches on it

“Kirkland and other researchers have established senescence as an important physiological process that appears to play seemingly opposing roles in vivo. On the one hand, senescent cells are thought to mediate tissue development when they form in the embryo, and also to promote tissue regeneration and wound repair in later life. However, as these zombie cells accumulate with age, they can ooze inflammatory proteins believed to cause tissue dysfunction and to push neighboring cells into senescence. Indeed, animal studies have suggested that destroying senescent cells can slow down age-related physical decline and boost overall health, and many researchers who study aging now regard senescence as a driver of the physical decline characteristic of old age and a contributor to a range of age-related diseases.”",1,1583294944,longevity

He will investigate whether a periodic low-calorie fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) can restore tissue function by removing senescent, or “old”, cells. These senescent cells accumulate with age while putting off apoptosis (or death at the end of the cell cycle). Specifically he will investigate if a FMD can help clear out the “old” cells and replace them with newly produced younger cells, thereby allowing for tissue rejuvenation and ultimately healthy aging.

,Humes-Bread,"&gt;excessively hostile post

I'm with Exxmorphing. I think your reply is excessively hostile. You and the OP have two different ways you're looking at things. You have a few concepts intertwinned, so I'll try to tease them apart. First is this idea of being a hypocrite for not really contributing. 

I do agree with your general statement on money allocation, and I have often thought about how to make things like science more popular/sexy. The problem with sports is that action, movement, and athleticism is something we deeply and innately connect with. The drama is intense and fast and has quick pay-offs. I think you could even make a post-hoc evolutionary claim that we are drawn to physical dominance and sports taps into this. With games, it's a different aspect also deeply rooted in human behavior, since games are designed around rewards and often follow behavioral reinforcement patterns/schedules. How does science compete with this, especially since science pay-offs are so far in the future (which dilutes their reinforcing power) and are of unknown probability (which also reduces their power)? I don't have a good answer to that question. If any of us did, I think we could do a lot of good in the world. Unfortunately, usually only scientists truly revere scientists. The rest of us will think -damn Einstein was smart. But we aren't looking to emulate him or to create more people like him. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Second, you have this idea of what affects us being important vs what may effect poor people. If you think from a Pareto perspective, where you order which causes of death are greatest down to least, you would see aging much much much higher on the list than infectious diseases and certainly much higher than COVID-19 alone. So if you say: ""what matters is saving the most lives,"" then tackling aging is what you go after and you encourage people to see from this perspective, regardless of how poor or rich any nation or individual is. If, however, you feel that the most needy and neglected are where the real value is, in terms of improving health, then you say- ""forget the old ones who are lucky enough to live a long life, we need to improve the health of those that will die of malnutrition before they reach 10."" This is a reasonable position too, but the two differ because they fundamentally value different things.

The Chinese engineered this in a lab as a bioweapon and it escaped!).

Pandemics will occur more often as global warming pushes animals from affected natural habitats into cities, and urbanization is turning more natural habitats for exotic species into cities where humans will have close contact with them. Much of the world's infrastructure fails to provide basic health necessities like clean water and clean public space to it's very poorest, creating a dangerous environment where new diseases can be picked up and spread, often with a huge head start before it's detected due to poor health monitoring services in those areas. There will be many more Corvid-19-like events in the coming decade.

And that is a huge problem, one that can affect aging research. Economists are forecasting that the yearly effect of Corvid-19 could be as high as 2% of the world's GDP. If pandemic research and prevention isn't taken seriously now to better provide infrastructure to prevent and respond to new pandemics, more wealth could be eaten up, which means less funding in the future for age research. It's in everyone's best interest to actually handle this shit.

There are benefits to tackling it as well! Pandemics, by there nature, are incredibly difficult to contain without international support, which creates a demand for global cooperation: imagine if health services and health researchers could work freely between countries, sharing data and information with each other; imagine how much the talent pool increases if medicinal research were globalized; imagine how much further along we could be if every country had a vested interest in making sure the population of every country was healthier, including for age-related diseases; imagine how much time, money and man power can be given to aging research if we no longer had to worry about diseases born from the poorest, unhealthiest places spreading worldwide.

,Exxmorphing,"It's not truly unhelpful.

You have a point, but your overall sentiment fails to be helpful. A person would walk away thinking, ""well, I'm already a hypocrite, so I'd be consistent to stay inactive about aging"" from reading your excessively hostile post. What you should succeeded in is making a person think is ""Corvid-19 is important, but it's not the only thing, so the attention I'm giving it means I need to give attention to aging as well.""

There's not really much to say about that until such a time as it's been replicated in a double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial with a non-homogeneous patient population, and the observed changes in epigenetic age (if any) can be linked to actual changes in health outcomes.

Don't get me wrong, it's genuinely interesting work, and worth further investigation since an intervention that can modify the epigenetic clock in humans is a huge step towards understanding the application and limitations of the epigenetic clock as a biomarker of aging directed interventions.

But the fact that previous studies have established HGH to have detrimental effects on human health when administered late in life means the TRIIM study is actually more of a reason to doubt the usefulness of epigenetic clocks as a biomarker of aging directed interventions.

I have heard that extreme CR 50\~% and above can adversely affect bone health in humans, and might do so too in other relatively long lived animals.

But some studies had suggested CR could work up to 65% restriction, with increased mortality in shorter lived animals.   A degree of restriction to which it would be impossible to scavenge for rich micronutrient food sources on such a restricted amount of calories.    Nor would one expect such rich micronutrient density to be found during a famine.   The lifespan extending  mechanisms of calorie restriction appear to work far past what is viable with dietary intake in the wild.

CR Mimetics have managed to extend lifespan on single cell  organisms up to 80~%.     Why some have failed on longer lived animals could be due to the age related decline of NAD+, as the current brand of CR mimetics work through NAD dependent sirtuins.   But CR mimetics combined with substances that boost NAD could potentially unlock the benefits of maximal CR, on lifespan, without increasing mortality or a need to decrease calories to such an extent.

Information from his case, epidemiological findings, and recent controlled studies in mouse models of ALS suggest that low-energy diets might render motor neurons vulnerable to degeneration, whereas high-energy diets are ameliorative. This contrasts with the effects of low-energy diets on various neuronal populations in the brain that respond adaptively, activating pathways that promote plasticity and resistance to disease. One reason that motor neurons might be selectively vulnerable to low-energy diets is that they are unable to engage neuroprotective responses to energetic stress response involving the protein chaperones, such as, heat-shock protein-70.

Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the growth of fatty lesions, atheromas, in blood vessel walls. This narrows and weakens blood vessels, leading to heart disease, and then ultimately the fatal rupture or blockage of a major vessel that causes a heart attack or stroke. This degeneration of the arteries is a universal process. It occurs to various degrees in every older person, and kills perhaps a sixth of humanity at the present time. The only reason that it doesn't kill everybody is that other degenerative process of aging manage to get in first, that data suggesting that this is most likely only a matter of a few years of difference. We are as old as our arteries, as they say.  
&gt; The pace at which atherosclerosis progresses is strongly driven by chronic inflammation. Excessive and constant inflammation is a feature of aging, with some people much worse off than others, and this variation in inflammatory burden goes a long way towards determining who will die, earlier than might otherwise be the case, due to the consequences of atherosclerosis. To understand why inflammation is important to this age-related condition, one needs to know something about the underlying processes that cause atherosclerotic lesions to form.  
&gt; Atherosclerosis is, in essence, a condition of dysfunctional macrophages. These immune cells are responsible for clearing out unwanted, excessive, or damaged lipids, such as cholesterols, from blood vessel walls. Those lipids are handed off to HDL particles to be returned to the liver for disposal. This works just fine in youth. With age, however, a greater fraction of circulating lipids become oxidized, and macrophages do not handle oxidized lipids well at all. They become dysfunctional foam cells, packed with lipids, and issuing inflammatory signals that draw in more macrophages to suffer the same fate. An atherosclerotic lesion is a macrophage graveyard, seeded by oxidized lipids, and growing via a feedback loop of inflammatory signaling and failing, dying macrophages.  
&gt; If there is greater systemic inflammation in the body, more macrophages will be drawn to lesions. It is also the case that macrophages attempting to clean up those lesions will be more prone to adopt an unhelpful inflammatory state if greater inflammatory signaling is present in the environment. Further, inflammation and excessive amounts of oxidizing molecules go hand in hand: more inflammation will thus tend to mean more oxidized cholesterols in circulation. This all contributes to a more rapid pace of progression for atherosclerosis.  
&gt; What causes one older person to have a greater level of chronic inflammation than another? One important variation between individuals is the status of chronic infection. Is there a greater burden of, to pick one important example, herpesviruses such as cytomegalovirus that cannot be cleared unaided by the human immune system and that corrode the immune system over time? Another feature is the one examined in today's research materials, the health of gums. A range of evidence suggests that the localized inflammation of gum disease does not stay localized, and in fact spreads chronic inflammation throughout the body, harming the heart and the brain - and accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis, thus raising the risk of suffering a stroke.",1,1582627136,longevity

Abstract:

&gt; Preclinical evidence suggests that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) boosts NAD+ levels and improves diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We aimed to determine if dietary NR supplementation in middle‐aged, obese, insulin‐resistant men affects mitochondrial respiration, content and morphology in skeletal muscle. In a randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial, 40 participants (age 40-70) received 1000 mg NR or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before and after the intervention. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was determined by high‐resolution respirometry on single muscle fibres. Protein abundance and mRNA expression were measured by Western blot and quantitative PCR analyses, respectively, and in a subset of the participants (placebo n = 8; NR n = 8) we quantified mitochondrial fractional area and mitochondrial morphology by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Protein levels of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), an essential NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme in skeletal muscle, decreased by 14% with NR. However, steady‐state NAD+ levels as well as gene expression and protein abundance of other NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes remained unchanged.  
&gt; Neither respiratory capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria nor abundance of mitochondrial associated proteins were affected by NR. Moreover, no changes in mitochondrial fractional area or network morphology were observed. Our data do not support the hypothesis that dietary NR supplementation has significant impact on skeletal muscle mitochondria in obese and insulin‐resistant men. Future studies on the effects of NR on human skeletal muscle may include both sexes and potentially provide comparisons between young and older people.

Part of the intro for rationale:

&gt; Boosting NAD+ metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy to counter age-related
functional decline and promote healthy aging (Bonkowski &amp; Sinclair, 2016). Progressive
deterioration of mitochondrial function (López-Otín et al., 2013) and NAD+ metabolism are
hallmarks of aging of mouse (Yoshino et al., 2011; Gomes et al., 2013; Frederick et al.,
2016; Zhou et al., 2016) and human tissues (Massudi et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015; Zhou et
al., 2016).  
&gt; Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with a range of agerelated pathologies, including obesity, insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), in which
defective regulation of glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle play an important role
(Montgomery &amp; Turner, 2015)

&gt; In humans, exercise remains the most powerful intervention
known to improve general metabolic health as well as stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and
function in skeletal muscle (Hesselink et al., 2016). In rodents, similar effects can be
achieved by supplementing NAD+
precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) (Canto et
al., 2012; Fang et al., 2017). No human clinical trials have been published, which investigate
if NR has the same effects in human skeletal muscle.",1,1582107523,longevity

My own still limited knowledge about aging suggests it’s actually kind of backwards; “how can possibly hope to treat cancer In the elderly without addressing the systemic problems of aging?” Is probably more accurate. 

But the rub there is the “systemic” part; hoping we can address a complex problem in a complex system (aging) with a simple solution (drugging particular molecular targets) is where I fear we may be engaging in wishful thinking.

Yes, it’s true a single success against aging as a whole would revolutionize medicine.

But that depends on failure rates for aging being similar to other ARDs; a 95% failure rate (similar to cancer) would be acceptable, a 99.999999995% failure rate would not be.

There’s also individual variation to consider; I believe even the ITP studies (correct me if I’m wrong /u/SnellYaLater) used genetically homogenous mice. Even if the basic mechanisms of aging are universal, people’s metabolic responses to drugs is not.

Which are in place. This is an assertion which will be true in some cases and not in others. Additionally, you offer no ethical argument for why this desire by a group, state employees, to do something outweighs an individual's self-ownership. 
   
What specific right do these people have to infringe upon others and where did it come from, what ethical principle was it derived from? 
    
&gt;And you're acting like this is self-evident (Circular argument)
  
It's not circular. The only coherent ethical unit is the individual, the fundamental ethical concept is self-ownership. Without self-ownership who could you make a case that people value safety? 
  
Those doing the infringing have the burden to prove their right to do so. People going about their lives aren't the initiators here. 
     
&gt;But like.. What regulations exactly? And why do you claim that I haven't considered alternatives? I never said or implied that I hadn't considered alternatives?
   
Regulation/standards don't have to come from state employees. Private entities create standards all the time. 
     
You wrote:
  
""But the vast majority of people benefit from drug regulations and are just fine with the system we have.""
  
Benefit compared to what? Who do you know the vast majority is just fine with the regulatory monopoly that exists now? What other options do they have? These would be needed to determine people's preferences. 
    
Since you didn't offer any alternatives it has to be assumed you don't have any ideas for them. 
     
&gt;You're also implying that people on average are well-equipped to decide whether or not it's safe to take whatever drugs they want.
   
I wrote a rather long paragraph about specialization in modern markets, people don't need expertise this service can be offered by organizations other than the state. And again, whether people are equipped to make the best decisions isn't only part of the equation, who has a right to force their decisions? 
    
&gt;I guess I just disagree with you on those points. You're right. I don't have hard data to prove it.
  
Respectfully, and without rancor, I think you need to look into why you think you or some group you support should use force/threats to make others abide by your preferences. 
   
Also, there's the issue with not being able to know that a utilitarian argument will play out as you wish. How do you prove the ends will occur to support the unethical means? 
    
&gt;I think we're on the same page here. Which is why I think its odd that you're ignoring the fact that prescription drug regulations exist exactly because of specialization.
  
I'm not ignoring it, I critique the monopoly regulatory organizations and the attendant lack of freedom of choice. And again, you're assuming that even if all regulations and regulators have the best intentions that their actions will not cause harms worse than the harms their actions are purported to address. 
   
It's a complex problem ethically and functionally when a person/group forcefully intervenes in other people's lives. 
    
&gt;But other people (physicians, scientists, public health experts) do. And those people decided the best thing for the general public would be to regulate their use.
  
I agree this is mostly true. But these aren't experts on markets, supply chains, they can't generate the variety and volume of solutions that others acting in markets can. 
  
Of course there will be bad outcomes from bad solutions, poor decisions, but these will exist in any methodology. 
    
&gt;Maybe they know something you don't?
  
They know a lot of things I don't. Again with the specialization. But I know a lot those people don't. And without being arrogant, I'm quite bright, outside of some complex mathematical theories, a lot of them, I've never run across a concept I didn't understand. I also have a lot of skill and experience in developing and running new methodologies or solutions in different fields. 
   
So when I see a group applying methods in a state regulatory framework it drives me crazy. State rules take years at best to implement, change is rare and very slow. This just doesn't work well. 
   
I think without those restrictions those same people I critique would do wonders, but most have intellectually demanding tasks and having taken time to look at the big picture. We all have to prioritize our time and efforts. 
     
&gt;You also clearly have a thing against the health care system and/or doctors. That's fine.
   
I have an issue with doctors who support systems that restrict their work. I have issues with doctors who don't realize first they're service providers. The stakes can be high in some cases, but in the vast majority they're not. In both my IT companies and construction companies there were similar situations. 
  
A poorly constructed structure can kill, kill multiple people. Yes there are state construction rules/inspectors but these would be impossible to enforce with any regularity. It is up to the builders and their ethics to makes sure their products/services are safe. 
   
Also, look at IT, you're surrounded by machines and software which if they fail will kill people, often many people. Just look at the latest Boeing failures which killed hundreds. Do software engineers demand people only use products from their state supported cartel? *AMA, licensing, hospital certificates of need, etc. 
    
I agree that safety is important and most people value it. But I just offered two examples of industries where just as many risks exists without the same regulatory framework. Construction does have quite a bit, but most of those are very specific to the type of work being done and were created in-industry before state rules were created. 
    
&gt;I remain unconvinced that we should make all prescription drugs OTC. Sorry.
  
Well good luck to you. I think I'll be proven correct soon enough- 3D printers and other home manufacturing tech will allow for personal drug manufacturing. We're already seeing it in other countries.

,StoicOptom,"The figure that tends to be thrown around for the number of years of life that we would attain by curing cancer as an entire entity is about 2 years. Targeting biological aging would have a far more profound impact on not just lifespan, but also healthspan. 

This seems self-evident to those that have looked at the evidence, yet much of modern medicine appears to exist without much care for cost-benefit analyses on the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), although QALYs are certainly an important metric in determining what drugs/interventions might be funded or FDA approved.  

However, based on the papers I've come across I have come to the (possibly premature) conclusion that much of modern medicine is even more useless than I'd initially thought, *particularly in the context of an aging population*. Certainly if I had a drug overdose, contracted an infectious disease, or lost a leg to a car accident, it would be undeniable that seeing a physician would be in my best interest - acute care is what they do best. But when as much as 90% of our healthcare costs are attributable to aging and its associated age-related diseases, the issue of chronic disease medicine is a different story entirely.

**My analysis of modern medicine is that it has *failed to do anything about healthspan despite continually increasing our lifespans*, such that people now spend a [greater proportion of life suffering than ever before](https://imgur.com/gallery/RGTqw8P). I focus on healthspan as the noblest goal of medicine here, because the most common knee-jerk argument against longevity research is that it would 'increase lifespan', and 'why would anyone want to be old?'**

This could be described as the false dichotomy between lifespan and healthspan, where people incorrectly assume that targeting aging biology would merely increase lifespan without increasing healthspan, despite decades of evidence in animal models suggesting that doing so would far more likely increase healthspan than increase lifespan (compression of morbidity).

I am curious if any readers here who are more familiar with healthcare (especially any MDs here interested in longevity) could try and refute my claim. Please see my reply to the /r/medicine Mod /u/PokeTheVeil for further elaboration: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ebuxpo/nature_medicine_looking_forward_25_years_the/fb7jf1w/

I don't really plan on reposting my criticism here to /r/medicine as I'm not confident that I would receive evidence-based replies worth replying to, [as based on some of my own interactions in the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ebuxpo/nature_medicine_looking_forward_25_years_the/).

Yet I do not seek to blame physicians that manage chronic diseases either as I have immense respect for their tireless work (even if I think such efforts are misguided), though I think this quote is of some relevance: 

#""It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."" - Upton Sinclair

That's also not to say that I'm supporting a conspiracy theory wherein physicians are actively trying to keep patients unhealthy for them to continually be paid high salaries - but I think it's certainly worth considering some form of unconscious bias that if age-related diseases did not exist, there would be far less demand for doctors or other health professionals. The quote also oversimplifies the situation as I'm sure that many physicians derive immense meaning from their work in helping patients. That is, it becomes even harder to see the reality that - for those who manage and treat age-related diseases - their efforts are effectively futile.",1,1581766903,longevity

&gt; BOSTON) — The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University announced today that Rejuvenate Bio has secured an exclusive worldwide license from the Harvard Office of Technology Development to commercialize a gene therapy technology developed at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Medical School (HMS) to prevent and treat several age-related diseases in dogs, extending their overall healthspan. The announcement follows the publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences (PNAS) of a study led by Harvard researchers detailing the technology’s efficacy in mitigating obesity, type II diabetes, heart failure, and renal failure in mice.

&gt; “We are very excited to translate our winning gene therapy work from mice to dogs, where there is a dearth of treatment options to combat age-related diseases,” said Daniel Oliver, CEO and co-founder of Rejuvenate Bio, who was formerly an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the Wyss Institute and a Blavatnik Fellow at Harvard Business School, and is a co-author of the PNAS publication.

&gt; Rejuvenate Bio has secured funding from the Department of Defense’s Small Business Innovation Research program, as well as seed funding from investors and a grant from the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club. With this support, the company has launched a pilot study testing its technology’s efficacy in halting mitral valve disease, which strikes the majority of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age eight and causes heart failure. Following demonstration of efficacy, they hope to expand their treatment to all dog breeds, as more than 7 million dogs in the US suffer from mitral valve disease.

&gt; “We are very passionate about and focused on dogs’ health, because so many dog owners around the world have to helplessly watch their beloved pets’ quality of life deteriorate as they age,” said co-author Noah Davidsohn, Ph.D., who is a co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Rejuvenate Bio and a former Research Scientist at the Wyss Institute and HMS. “We want to get rid of the morbidities associated with aging, so dogs can be as happy and healthy as possible throughout their lives.”

,Hizvidal,"I was just reading through that, and while I don’t think anything said there is wrong, in my opinion it is a bit too pessimistic. 

For example, the idea that there are too many types of damage to address one-at-a-time is true – but only if you assume that each new treatment will only affect very specific damage. SENS has divided damage up into 7 categories with the hope that new treatments will be able to treat many ‘species’ of damage, as long as they’re in the same category. Granted, we don’t actually have any SENS therapies yet, but senolytics are the closest. Even though there are many different kinds of cells in your body that can become senescent, and they can produce many different SASP factors and phenotypes, there is enough commonality that we have senolytics in clinical trials right now that can clear a significant portion of senescent cells in the body (at least in mice). And with a bit of refining and a decade of research, it’s likely we’ll have treatments that can clear almost all of them. It *is* possible that we will need unique treatments for every kind of damage in the body, but in my opinion that’s being too pessimistic. 

With regard to low hanging fruit in the aging space – it depends on your definition of low-hanging fruit. Is 20 years of development for 5-10 years of healthspan considered low-hanging fruit? Cause I think it’s a reasonable bet that treatments will be available in twenty years that can achieve that, even if it takes another decade for them to become widespread. If the concern is that these therapies may not extend maximum lifespan, then I would tend to agree - that's probably going to be harder. But maximum lifespan for humans is around 120, while life expectancy is in the 80s for most developed countries – and often that last 5-10 years of that can be spent in agonisingly poor health. I’m sure I don’t need to extoll the benefits of increasing healthspan here, but it is a very worthwhile goal even if there are no increases to maximum lifespan.

There’s nothing we can really do about the drug failure rate though, just keep addressing problems with many different attempts and from many different angles. Thankfully we are seeing a huge increase in start-ups and investment in the rejuvenation biotech space – [you can see over 100 listed here.](http://agingbiotech.info/companies/) It’s not overly optimistic to think some of them will succeed.

With regards to combining treatments, I think we can be optimistic here also. Take senolytics for example: one of the treatments being researched is dasatinib and quercetin, which have a half-life in the body of about 11 hours. The treatment given to patients is a three-day course of dasatinib and quercetin, which appears to be effective at reducing senescent cells. As chronic senescent cells take weeks (if not longer) to build up again, you don’t need to take this medication continuously to gain the benefits. So in the future, you might take a three day course of senolytics, gain the benefits of a reduced senescent cell burden, wait a few days for the drugs to leave your body, and then take another anti-aging treatment with little risk of interactions. We might not be so lucky with other treatments, but again, I don’t think there’s reason to be overly pessimistic here.

Abstract:

&gt; Age-dependent loss of hypothalamic neural stem cells (htNSCs) is important for the pathological consequences of aging; however, it is unclear what drives the senescence of htNSCs. Here, we report that a long non-coding RNA, Hnscr, is abundantly expressed in the htNSCs of young mice but decreases markedly in middle-aged mice. We show that depletion of Hnscr is sufficient to drive the senescence of htNSCs and aging-like phenotypes in mice. Mechanistically, Hnscr binds to Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) to prevent its degradation and thus the attenuation of transcription of the senescence marker gene p16INK4A. Through molecular docking, we discovered that a naturally occurring small compound, theaflavin 3-gallate, can mimic the activity of Hnscr. Treatment of middle-aged mice with theaflavin 3-gallate reduced the senescence of htNSCs while improving aging-associated pathology. These results point to a mediator of the aging process and one that can be pharmacologically targeted to improve aging-related outcomes.

Prior research: [Hypothalamic programming of systemic ageing involving IKK-β, NF-κB and GnRH [2013]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12143) 
[pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756938/pdf/nihms463346.pdf)

&gt; Ageing is a result of gradual and overall functional deteriorations across the body; however, it is unknown whether an individual tissue primarily works to mediate the ageing progress and control lifespan. Here we show that the hypothalamus is important for the development of whole-body ageing in mice, and that the underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated by IκB kinase-β (IKK-β), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and related microglia–neuron immune crosstalk. Several interventional models were developed showing that ageing retardation and lifespan extension are achieved in mice by preventing ageing-related hypothalamic or brain IKK-β and NF-κB activation. Mechanistic studies further revealed that IKK-β and NF-κB inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to mediate ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline, and GnRH treatment amends ageing-impaired neurogenesis and decelerates ageing. In conclusion, the hypothalamus has a programmatic role in ageing development via immune–neuroendocrine integration, and immune inhibition or GnRH restoration in the hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies for optimizing lifespan and combating ageing-related health problems.",1,1580707344,longevity
,Humes-Bread,"&gt;we think it is fair to state that over 15 years after the completion of the HGP there is no noticeable global impact on drug development and health

I'm really surprised by this and have a hard time believing it, unless we define impact narrowly. What about all the downstream discoveries? The identification of genes associated with increased probability of breast cancer, for example- or the ability to now genotype a particular cancer in order to better target therapy? Yes, the reach is still small at the moment, but I think that has more to do with how much there is to know and not that the program wasn't valuable.

,cryo-curious,"&gt;From these and similar observations, we think it is fair to state that over 15 years after the completion of the HGP there is no noticeable global impact on drug development and health. Given the estimated costs of this project with over $2.7 billion USD, there are valuable lessons to be learned for future projects.

&gt;First, we are of the opinion that expectations of research projects should be realistic. Since the introduction of the epigenetic landscape (Waddington, 1939) it is clear that there is a huge difference between individual genes and interactions between genes. Whereas the functional implications of the former is only clear in special cases, e.g., cystic fibrosis, the latter is the generic level of understanding for complex phenotypes and disorders like cancer, diabetes or schizophrenia. Hence, a project aiming for the individual gene level, as the HGP, can not lead to insights about complex phenotypes. It is clear that funding bodies like to advertise potential results of their projects as big as possible, but scientists should withstand such temptations because in retrospective, one can always assess the results to unveil a potential hype.

&gt;As a corollary from this, we are of the opinion that the expectations about “common” research projects, receiving funding in the order of magnitude of $105 USD, need to be placed into perspective. That means realistic expectations of the impact from such projects on the society is about 10, 000 fold less than that of the HGP, because the HGP received more funding by a factor 10, 000. Hence, modesty in the formulation of goals and their potential impact should be appreciated.

&gt;Second, looking back in the history of science, revolutionary breakthroughs seem the result of individual scientists (with rather small groups and support) and not from multi-billion Dollar projects, like the HGP. For this reason, we suggest not to support such expensive projects in the future but, instead, distribute the funding among many small groups. In this way the likelihood of intellectual scientific progress is enlarged because many people work in parallel in a creative way on diverse problems. On the other hand, we acknowledge the need to develop biotechnology that is useful for conducting modern experiments. However, such projects need to be termed honestly and not disguised by marketing slogans in order to make them look more interesting than they in fact are.

&gt;Third, we would like to note that the HGP did not formulate any particular biological hypothesis to be tested but it's goal was to sequence the human genome with technology developed for this purpose. In other words the measurable outcome is the technology itself and as a specific result the human DNA. Put simply, the outcome is a general purpose tool, like a hammer. It can be used but it is up to you for what. Certainly, none would say that the Mona Lisa—the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci—is attributed to the person who developed the hammer to hang the paining. In analogy it seem unreasonable to even compare the HGP to, e.g., the potential impact of the HPV vaccine to reduce mortality from cervical cancer, which was FDA approved in 2006 (Roden and Wu, 2006), based on the development of a drug resulting from dedicated experiments hypothesizing that this drug is beneficial in the treatment of cervical cancer. The honest assessment is that the HGP did not propose anything alike and hence anything that is a result of the application of its technologies should not be credited to it but the creativity of the researches that performed dedicated experiments to test specific hypothesis.

&gt;We are of the opinion that completed scientific projects of the size of the HGP need to undergo a rigorous assessment otherwise avoidable mistakes will be repeated in future projects. In general, we plead for more modesty, honesty and realism when proposing research projects and potential results because science is not like marketing where the ultimate goal is to sell a product by all means.",1,1580620188,longevity

Currently, about 30% of health care expenditure (totalling 100 billion a year, so about 30 billion) in my country (the Netherlands) goes to elderly care, a large part of which goes to a small subgroup of elderly with multiple health conditions. Any curative treatment for even some of their many afflictions is going to dramatically reduce those costs due to it reducing the amount of labour needed to care for these people.

For example: someone with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose vascular stiffness is resolved is going to have less orthostatic hypotension (due to the arteries and veins being able to compensate for position changes better), resulting in less falls, less fractures, less (exorbitantly expensive) emergency room visits, less delirium and therefore not only more quality of life but also a decreased amount of caretaker labour needed.",1,1580411544,longevity

Neither. This is basic research; the authors generated a line of mice with progeria, and examined the role of the SASP secretions from endothelial cells in the impaired nutrient sensing capabilities of aged cells.

Key caveats are that this is a mouse study, and involved mice with progeria, which models some of the effects of aging, but not all of them.

It's yet another piece of evidence that implicates sensecent cells as being directly causative in age related diseases states, and offers more insight into the wide ranging physiological effects of senescent cells, but at the end of the day what matters as far as human health is concerned is the actual effect of senescent cells targeted therapies on human aging.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/sunscreen-absorbed-bloodstream-testing-needed/story%3fid=68442221

&gt;Sunscreens were first regulated by the F.D.A. in the 1970s, and they were considered over-the-counter medications, before current American guidelines for the evaluation of drugs were put in place. Because of this, sunscreens didn’t undergo testing the way modern pharmaceuticals would.
In Europe, things are even more lax. Sunscreens are regulated as cosmetics, and because of this, many more sunscreens are approved there than in the United States.

The F.D.A., however, has wanted to know: To what degree are chemicals applied to the skin absorbed into the body, and what are the possible effects of those chemicals?
We now have information about the first question. A few weeks ago, a study was published in JAMA that randomly assigned 24 healthy people to one of four sunscreens. Two of them were sprays, the third was a lotion, and the fourth was a cream. Participants were instructed to apply the sunscreens to 75 percent of their bodies four times a day for four days, and 30 blood samples were drawn over a week.

&gt;The F.D.A.’s guidance says that any active ingredient that achieves systemic absorption greater than 0.5 nanograms per milliliter of blood should undergo a toxicology assessment to see if it causes “cancer, birth defects or other adverse effects.”
The study examined four common sunscreen components: avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene and ecamsule. For all four, systemic concentrations passed the nanogram threshold after the applications on the first day of the study. The levels were higher than the limit for the entire week for all the products except the cream.
They also increased from Day 1 to Day 4, meaning that there was accumulation of the chemical in the body with continued use.

**Highlights**:

&gt; * A meeting summary highlights the recent progress on basic research and clinical trials of the fundamental molecule NAD+.

&gt; * There are major gaps to apply laboratory science to design the most effective trials, and this meeting was aimed to fill this gap.

&gt; * The plans or progresses of four NAD+-based clinical trials in Norway were discussed which will provide valuable information for clinicians who are going to perform similar clinical trials.

&gt; * Conflicting clinical efficacy reports of NAD+ highlight that there is a need to consider in which clinical settings NAD+ repletion should be attempted and how future studies should be designed.

**Abstract**:

&gt; Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) plays a fundamental role in life and health through the regulation of energy biogenesis, redox homeostasis, cell metabolism, and the arbitration of cell survival via linkages to apoptosis and autophagic pathways. The importance of NAD+ in ageing and healthy longevity has been revealed from laboratory animal studies and early-stage clinical testing. While basic researchers and clinicians have investigated the molecular mechanisms and translation potential of NAD+, there are still major gaps in applying laboratory science to design the most effective trials.  

&gt; This mini-review was based on the programme and discussions of the 3rd NO-Age Symposium held at the Akershus University Hospital, Norway on the 28th October 2019. This symposium brought together leading basic researchers on NAD+ and clinicians who are leading or are going to perform NAD+ augmentation-related clinical studies.  

&gt; This meeting covered talks about NAD+ synthetic pathways, subcellular homeostasis of NAD+, the benefits of NAD+ augmentation from maternal milk to offspring, current clinical trials of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) on Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), Parkinson’s disease (PD), post-sepsis fatigue, as well as other potential NR-based clinical trials. Importantly, a consensus is emerging with respect to the design of clinical trials in order to measure meaningful parameters and ensure safety.",1,1580074176,longevity

&gt; Bernard is skeptical about the concept of biological age.

From 2000 to 2015, we've added 3.7 years to the average person living in a rich country's life, and 3.2 of those years are in good health.

Perspectives:

The drawback being that long term effects are unknown, and there are no direct comparisons to things like exercise alone, nor data on [epigenetic age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic_clock).   Some [limited evidence](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.14814/phy2.14139) for exercise improving NAD+ metabolism does exist.  Further research is needed reveal more information.

Additional general criticism is that simply raising NAD+ in humans may fail to take into account treating all the hallmarks of aging, and may just line the pockets of the patent holders and the supplement companies compared to focusing on better research and interventions.  For this reason, it may be best to wait for more conclusive results on the effects of NR, NMN and cheaper alternatives rather than being an early adopter.

We investigate the history of the human exposome for relationships between novel environmental toxins and genetic changes during human evolution in six phases. Phase I: With increased walking on savannas, early human ancestors inhaled crustal dust, fecal aerosols, and spores; carrion scavenging introduced new infectious pathogens. Phase II: Domestic fire exposed early Homo to novel toxins from smoke and cooking. Phases III and IV: Neolithic to preindustrial Homo sapiens incurred infectious pathogens from domestic animals and dense communities with limited sanitation. Phase V: Industrialization introduced novel toxins from fossil fuels, industrial chemicals, and tobacco at the same time infectious pathogens were diminishing. Thereby, pathogen-driven causes of mortality were replaced by chronic diseases driven by sterile inflammogens, exogenous and endogenous. Phase VI: Considers future health during global warming with increased air pollution and infections.

&gt; Dietary methionine (Met) restriction (MR) extends lifespan in rodents by 30–40% and inhibits growth. Since glycine is the vehicle for hepatic clearance of excess Met via glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), we hypothesized that dietary glycine supplementation (GS) might produce biochemical and endocrine changes similar to MR and also extend lifespan.  
&gt; Seven-week-old male Fisher 344 rats were fed diets containing 0.43% Met/2.3% glycine (control fed; CF) or 0.43% Met/4%, 8% or 12% glycine until natural death. In 8% or 12% GS rats, median lifespan increased from 88 weeks (w) to 113 w, and maximum lifespan increased from 91 w to 119 w v CF. Body growth reduction was less dramatic, and not even significant in the 8% GS group. Dose-dependent reductions in several serum markers were also observed. Long-term (50 w) 12% GS resulted in reductions in mean (±SD) fasting glucose (158 ± 13 v 179 ± 46 mg/dL), insulin (0.7 ± 0.4 v 0.8 ± 0.3 ng/mL), IGF-1 (1082 ± 128 v 1407 ± 142 ng/mL) and triglyceride (113 ± 31 v 221 ± 56 mg/dL) levels compared to CF. Adiponectin, which increases with MR, did not change in GS after 12 w on diet.  
&gt; We propose that more efficient Met clearance via GNMT with GS could be reducing chronic Met toxicity due to rogue methylations from chronic excess methylation capacity or oxidative stress from generation of toxic by-products such as formaldehyde. This project received no outside funding.

&gt; Preliminary experiments suggested lifespan extension by glycine supplementation (GlyS) without the growth inhibition seen with methionine restriction in Fisher 344 rats. This suggested that the benefit GlyS, rather than owing to increased methionine clearance (as was originally envisioned), was attributable to increased levels of glycine itself, acting via the glycine receptor.  
&gt; The glycine receptor is a glycine-gated chloride channel that is widespread among cell types, including macrophages, and GlyS has been shown by others to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties in several rodent models, and even to reverse Type 2 diabetes in a human trial. GlyS has also recently been found by others to restore the youthful mitochondrial phenotype in senescent cultured human fibroblasts, whose senescence was linked to epigenetic down-regulation of the principal pathways of endogenous glycine synthesis.  
&gt; The present study set out to replicate the life extension previously observed in rats, in large, reproducible populations of UM-HET-3, 4-way cross mice, in a Phase I Interventions Testing Program (ITP) trial of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Beginning at 9 months of age, GlyS mice were fed a diet containing 8% glycine (dry weight, compared to the level of 2.3% in the control diet) simultaneously at 3 sites (The Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; U.T. Health San Antonio, TX), employing approximately 50 each of male and female GlyS and 100 each of male and female controls at each site. Data were compiled after 90% of control mice had died at all 3 sites. 

&gt; Pooling data from all 3 sites (shown in Figure below), median lifespan was increased among GlyS mice by 3.7% among females and 1.3% among males, and the 90th percentile lifespan was increased by 1.8% among females and 3.6% among males (p = 0.00004 by log-rank test and p = 0.002 by Wang-Allison test for pooled males and females at all 3 sites combined). The observed lifespan extension is statistically robust, in that significant log-rank p-values were seen for each sex (pooling across site) and for each site (pooling across sexes).

Pooling across sex, glycine increased lifespan at each of the three independent sites, with significance at p = 0.01, 0.053, and 0.03, respectively. Glycine-supplemented females were lighter than controls, but there was no effect on weight in males.

A few quotes, highlighting this is research relevant to aging / increasing healthspan (the period free of disability) but not longevity.   

&gt; Exercise is among the most effective interventions for age-associated mobility decline and metabolic dysregulation. 

...

&gt; As the percentage of elderly members in the population continues to increase, concerns about increased health care responsibilities have been amplified as well. Interventions that can preserve proper body function at advanced ages are thus of substantial importance. In repeated surveys, elderly members of the community have mentioned preservation of mobility as their biggest concern associated with aging1. Mobility is important both for direct health reasons (e.g. preventing falls, retaining access to relatives and health care providers) and for psychological reasons, as it is highly correlated with retained personal satisfaction and morale2,3. Identification of cost-effective therapies that can preserve independence and healthy mobile capacity in the elderly would therefore have a cumulatively positive effect, influencing many other aspects of mental and physical health in a wide population demographic.

&gt; One promising therapeutic intervention to impede age-related functional decline is endurance exercise. Endurance training induces remodeling in muscle tissue that alters the metabolic health of the entire organism4,5,6. Evidence from humans and model organisms strongly suggests that endurance exercise has substantially protective effects on various indices of healthspan7. In vertebrates, endurance training leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis/efficiency8, decreased triglyceride storage9, improved insulin sensitivity10, and protection of both muscle and neural functions11. These changes are often thought to be at least partially mediated by exercise-induced upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the insulin-AKT pathway12. These remodeling events lead to increased physiological capacity in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. **However, substantial obstacles exist against the widespread application of endurance therapy in the human population. Many humans are unable to reach the level of training necessary to generate these remodeling steps for several reasons: (1) age, (2) injury, (3) illness, or (4) social commitments that require long sedentary periods. Therefore, generation of therapeutic mimetics to induce the benefits of exercise could provide broad ranging benefits to the medical community.**

...

&gt; These observations further support the idea that Sestrin is an important integrator of various signaling pathways, and its effects cannot be fully replicated by modulation of a single downstream output.

&gt;  It should be noted that, in both humans and mice, endurance exercise training improves healthspan but is not effective for extending maximal lifespan57,58. Also in flies, exercise training improved running capacity and flight performance27, but did not increase longevity59. These results indicate that Sestrin is a specific regulator of healthspan, not longevity.",1,1578913124,longevity

&gt; NEW YORK, Jan. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Elysium Health, Inc.™, a life sciences company developing clinically validated health products based on advancements in scientific research, today announced the initiation of a clinical trial at Duke Clinical Research Institute to study correlations between biological age and circulating NAD+ levels in healthy adults, in addition to other clinical biomarkers that have been implicated in aging. As opposed to marking calendar years, biological age is the average age an individual's body is expected to function and is a powerful measure of overall health and wellness. Biological age will be calculated using Elysium Health's next-generation epigenetic platform, Algorithmic Platform for Epigenetic Examination (APEX), which the company developed to support the 2019 launch of its at-home epigenetic test Index

&gt; Published biological age applications such as DNAm PhenoAge typically look at hundreds of sites on the genome. To ensure greater accuracy at the individual level, Elysium Health head of bioinformatics and Yale School of Medicine professor Dr. Morgan Levine led the development of a proprietary measure that examines global methylation patterns across more than 100,000 sites in collaboration with Elysium Health bioinformatics director Dr. Tina Hu-Seliger. A key consideration for developing the methodology that underlies APEX and Index was the need to refine the technology to address the inherent variability of earlier epigenetic age predictors. Later this year, Elysium Health intends to publish the data that supports its methodology, and which demonstrates that Index is a better predictor of biological age than earlier measures

&gt; As an essential coenzyme involved in hundreds of metabolic processes, NAD+ is critical to cellular metabolism; and its reduced form, NADH, is required for mitochondrial metabolism and the resulting synthesis of ATP for cellular energy creation. NAD+ is also utilized by sirtuins, often referred to as the ""guardians of the genome."" NAD+ levels have been shown to decline with age in humans in circulating blood as well as skin and brain tissue. Although the underlying causes for deteriorating NAD+ levels have not yet been fully determined, understanding correlations between epigenetic aging and NAD+ levels may help elucidate the benefits of maintaining NAD+ levels with age

&gt; ""Over the past decade, epigenetic tests have evolved to measure biological age with an increasing level of accuracy,"" said Elysium Health chief scientist and director of the Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at MIT Dr. Leonard Guarente. ""Having studied aging for more than 30 years, it's my belief that the field is at a tipping point. The newfound ability to measure biological age allows us to study whether interventions can have an impact, thus unlocking the potential to realize the benefits of aging research in our lifetime.

&gt; This study is intended to further the understanding of the links between NAD+ levels and other markers of biological age. In the study, NAD+ levels in whole blood, interleukins, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and patterns in DNA methylation will be measured and compared in age-matched individuals to determine whether NAD+ levels are associated with biological age

&gt; One hundred and seventy healthy adults ages 25–80 will be enrolled in the study, which is scheduled to complete in May 2020. More information can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier [NCT04220658](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04220658?term=elysium&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1).",1,1578599916,longevity

The compression of morbidity in public health is a hypothesis put forth by James Fries, professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. The hypothesis was supported by a 1998 study of 1700 University of Pennsylvania alumni over a period of 20 years.Fries' hypothesis is that the burden of lifetime illness may be compressed into a shorter period before the time of death, if the age of onset of the first chronic infirmity can be postponed. This hypothesis contrasts to the view that as the age of countries' populations tends to increase over time, they will become increasingly infirm and consume an ever-larger proportion of the national budget in healthcare costs.Fries posited that if the hypothesis is confirmed, healthcare costs and patient health overall will be improved. In order to confirm this hypothesis, the evidence must show that it is possible to delay the onset of infirmity, and that corresponding increases in longevity will at least be modest.

,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is one of the most common disorders affecting elderly individuals. There is an urgent need for effective preventive measures for ARHL because none are currently available. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a premature aging disease that presents with progressive hearing loss at a young age, but is otherwise similar to ARHL.  
&gt; There are two human genetic complementation groups of CS, A and B. While the clinical phenotypes in patients are similar, the proteins have very diverse functions, and insight into their convergence is of great interest. Here, we use mouse models for CS (CSA−/− and CSBm/m) that recapitulate the hearing loss in human CS patients. We previously showed that NAD+, a key metabolite with various essential functions, is reduced in CS and associated with multiple CS phenotypes.  
&gt; In this study, we report that NAD+ levels are reduced in the cochlea of CSBm/m mice and that short-term treatment (10 days) with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), prevents hearing loss, restores outer hair cell loss, and improves cochlear health in CSBm/m mice. Similar, but more modest effects were observed in CSA−/− mice. Remarkably, we observed a reduction in synaptic ribbon counts in the presynaptic zones of inner hair cells in both CSA−/− and CSBm/m mice, pointing to a converging mechanism for cochlear defects in CS. Ribbon synapses facilitate rapid and sustained synaptic transmission over long periods of time. Ribeye, a core protein of synaptic ribbons, possesses an NAD(H) binding pocket which regulates its activity.  Intriguingly, NAD+ supplementation rescues reduced synaptic ribbon formation in both CSA−/− and CSBm/m mutant cochleae. These findings provide valuable insight into the mechanism of CS- and ARHL-associated hearing loss, and suggest a possible intervention",1,1578473820,longevity

Jeanne Louise Calment (French: [ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃]; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French supercentenarian from Arles, and the oldest human whose age was well-documented, with a lifespan of 122 years and 164 days. Her longevity attracted media attention and medical studies of her health and lifestyle.

According to census records, Calment outlived both her daughter and grandson. She was widely reported to have been the oldest living person in 1988 at 112, and was declared the oldest person ever in 1995 at age 120.Some researchers have challenged Calment's extreme age due to statistical unlikelihood, and have examined the possibility that her daughter Yvonne may have assumed Calment's identity in 1934.

So, a notion of freedom and a society that becomes so callous to the minimal demands of what Marx called “human requirements”… human requirements… it’s not utopian to demand human requirements. That’s the standard objection any time you use the word “Marx” – so that’s why I am sort of getting away from it there – “must be utopian”. **No, it’s not utopian to demand that in a world with this kind of technology, that as a moral demand, a society feed, clothe and house its people. A society that doesn’t do it, with the kind of technology and the wealth we have is beneath contempt and makes a mockery of all the previous history of civilisation.**

u/Drpnsmbd said that if it were possible to radically extend the human lifespan then there'd be lots of very rick people ""dumping all their savings into"" research and then withholding the results of that research from the public. That's the ""conspiracy"" part. Withholding or hiding anti-ageing treatment from the masses when/if it becomes available. u/TotalMegaCool rightly points out how silly a move that is. Firstly, because there's very little to gain from hiding or hording such a thing. Secondly, because even if we assume that this is something that's very expensive it's still beneficial to release it to the public and make it as widely available as possible. Finally, because the healthcare savings from governments would put tremendous political pressure on distributing such a thing as widely as possible.

A average mortgage is around 25 years with first-home buyers taking out 30-35 year mortgages nowadays. The way real estate finance works is by extending the ability of poorer people to afford property with these types of loans. You probably can't afford to spend $100k on anything but a $100k mortgage on a house is really cheap. Imagine from the perspective of a large bank a world where people will not only take out a second mortgage but where they can works for longer and therefore borrow more over a longer period of time. Similarly, most longevity research is focused on improving a person's health span and therefore the length of time one can work. It's not strange to think that if longevity treatments become available there'd be loans available to help pay for them and government incentive to do so paid for with the healthcare savings, welfare savings and economic activity of a suddenly much more productive workforce.

There are very few people in this world who cause suffering for the sake of causing suffering. Even in those cases however, there's an active financial and political incentive to make anti-ageing/life prolonging/health-span extending treatments as widely available as possible such that any efforts by bad actors looking to induce suffering for their own kicks and giggles are quickly overwhelmed by folks with dollar signs in place of eyes. That's a very separate issue from the way the American healthcare and pharmaceutical industry operates. And indeed the way America's pharmaceutical industry operates (i.e. with maximum greed) may very well help the spread of such medication since if you can now suddenly work an extra 30 years you can take out a 30 year loan to pay for your medication so how expensive it is (within reason obviously) is not a barrier.",11,1578198423,longevity

&gt;Over the last decade the amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has come under intense scrutiny. International laboratory and epidemiological research continues to support the hypothesis that environmental exposure to BMAA (e.g., through dietary practices, water supply) can promote the risk of various neurodegenerative diseases. A wide variety of cyanobacteria spp. have previously been reported to produce BMAA, with production levels dependent upon species, strain and environmental conditions. Since spirulina (Arthrospira spp.) is a member of the cyanobacteria phylum frequently consumed via dietary supplements, the presence of BMAA in such products may have public health implications. In the current work, we have analyzed ten spirulina-containing samples for the presence of BMAA; six pure spirulina samples from two separate raw materials suppliers, and four commercially-available multi-ingredient products containing 1.45 g of spirulina per 8.5 g serving. Because of controversy surrounding the measurement of BMAA, we have used two complementary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods: one based on reversed phase LC (RPLC) with derivatization and the other based on hydrophilic interaction LC (HILIC). Potential matrix effects were corrected for by internal standardization using a stable isotope labeled BMAA standard. BMAA was not detected at low limits of detection (80 ng/g dry weight) in any of these product samples. Although these results are reassuring, BMAA analyses should be conducted on a wider sample selection and, perhaps, as part of ongoing spirulina production quality control testing and specifications.",2,1578067231,longevity

&gt;	Inhibition of mTORC1 (mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1) with the pharmaceutical rapamycin prolongs the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms including rodents, with evidence now emerging that rapamycin and its analogs may also have rejuvenative effects in dogs and humans. However, the side effects associated with long-term rapamycin treatment, many of which are due to inhibition of a second mTOR complex, mTORC2, have seemed to preclude the routine use of rapamycin as a therapy for age-related diseases. Here, we discuss recent findings suggesting that strong, chronic inhibition of both mTOR complexes may not be necessary to realize the geroprotective effects of rapamycin. Instead, modestly but specifically inhibiting mTORC1 via a variety of emerging techniques, including intermittent or transient treatment with rapamycin derivatives, or specific dietary regimens, may be sufficient to promote health and longevity with reduced side effects. We will also discuss prospects for the development of new molecules that, by harnessing the detailed molecular understanding of mTORC1 signaling developed over the last decade, will provide new routes to the selective inhibition of mTORC1. We conclude that therapies based on the selective inhibition of mTORC1 may soon permit the safer treatment of diseases of aging.",1,1578008626,longevity

,InfinityArch,"&gt;I’m not saying aging research is not worth it. I’m doing it after all. The point I’m making is that people need to be excited about 5-10 year gains in human lifespan in their lifetime, not disappointed that we don’t make 1000 year leaps. We should all accept and be prepared for death, but hopeful that we may enjoy a better and longer life than our ancestors.

5-10 years is what we'd expect from the conventional, single disease approach; that's more or less in line with historical life expectancy trends. The case for aging research is that it could potentially be considerably times more effective than treating cancer, or dementia, or heart disease, and so on; increases healthy life expectancy by three or so years would have a similar impact in public health terms to curing cancer.

I (and many others) consider the quality of those years to be of greater importance than the quantity, and that's another area where aging as a treatment target seems to shine, but I'm not sure I'm on board with the broadly held belief that we're only going to compress morbidity with little to no effect on overall.

For starters, we don't treat lab mice when they fall ill unless that's part of the experiment, and while our treatments for age related diseases are often considered rather ineffective, that's in no small part due to the loss of resilience that comes with age; an elderly patient often isn't strong enough to survive a life saving surgery, and can't bounce back like a younger patient. Recapitulating some of that resilience in old age would mean much better outcomes with the treatments we do have.

&amp;#x200B;

But I digress; 5-10 years over the next 20-40 years. But where do we go from there? I don't really see a particularly compelling reason why it would stop at 5-10 years, especially given that aging research will almost certainly blow past cancer research in terms of funding in both industry and academia if this actually happens.

It's often held that aging is just too complicated for the brute force/survival of the fittest approach of big pharma and biotech respectively to ever work, but is that actually true, or just some ""common sense"" that everyone agrees on? Cancer is also extraordinarily complicated, and we've made noticeable progress against cancer over the past 30 and especially 15 years. That's in spite of greater than 95% failure rates in oncology clinical trials, and we're finally starting to see successes against metastatic cancers. We're doing even better when it comes to diabetes and certain kinds of heart disease.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way that's just kind of speculation now. I don't think we actually know enough to say how easy or hard modifying aging in humans will be compared to model system. I'm rather wary of any prediction about the state of technology more than a few decades into the future; even when it comes to genuine subject matter experts the track record is beyond abysmal for those kinds of things.",1,1577754009,longevity

Keep an eye on the roadmap: https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/




Creatine extends healthy lifespan in mice.   Since Sinclair uses mice for a lot of the claims he's making, so I would not be concerned if you follow his reasoning.

[Creatine in mouse models of neurodegeneration and aging (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21390530)

&gt; As aging and neurodegeneration share pathophysiological pathways, we investigated the effect of oral creatine supplementation on aging in 162 aged wild-type C57Bl/6J mice. The median healthy life span of creatine-fed mice was 9% higher than in their control littermates, and they performed significantly better in neurobehavioral tests.
In brains of creatine-treated mice, there was a trend toward a reduction of reactive oxygen species and significantly lower accumulation of the ""aging pigment"" lipofuscin. Expression profiling showed an upregulation of genes implicated in neuronal growth, neuroprotection, and learning. These data showed that creatine improves health and longevity in mice. Creatine may, therefore, be a promising food supplement to promote healthy human aging.
However, the strong neuroprotective effects in animal studies of creatine have not been reproduced in human clinical trials (that have been conducted in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The reasons for this translational gap are discussed. One obvious cause seems to be that all previous human studies may have been underpowered. Large phase III trials over long time periods are currently being conducted for Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, and will possibly solve this issue.

I think now that the scientific community (including increasing numbers of physician researchers) has basically endorsed the idea that biological ageing is interventionable and is the correct approach to treating age-related diseases, the next transition in changing our approach to medicine is one that has to be done at a political level. 

I feel that there is a distinct lack of advocacy going on about our ageing population - just look at the NEJM publication (""*[Climate Change — A Health Emergency](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1817067)*"", which evoked significant attention in both the public and medical community. While I believe this response by the physician community was justified, it is concerning that we've seen almost no such response to our ageing population - likely the biggest crisis that will dominate the forseeable future.

As a whole, physicians are a rather powerful entity at a societal, political and economic level, yet it seems that this issue is not being taken seriously - we are seeing an impending crisis unfold. This is reflected by largely useless inititatives like the WHO's *Decade of Healthy Ageing*, of which they failed to provide a single reference to supporting interventions against biological ageing. Fortunately, this is slowly changing as we are seeing attitudes change among prominent physicians - notably Victor Dzau, the President of the United States National Academy of Medicine (*[Enabling Healthful Aging for All — The National Academy of Medicine Grand Challenge in Healthy Longevity](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1912298?query=featured_home)*).



The primary reason I believe that the success of the TAME trial is crucial (at least for the near future) is that it would serve as an exemplar of a clinical trial that shows that human ageing is amenable to intervention (even though it's obvious that things like optimal exercise/diet slow ageing). From my recent interactions with some physicians of /r/medicine, it seems that their intense scepticism is based on the idea that no matter how significant the results are within animal models, they are meaningless until clinical trials are run in humans - physicians deal with humans after all.",1,1577320801,longevity

Effect of resveratrol on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Theodotou M, et al. Exp Ther Med. 2019.

Abstract
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a micronized formulation of trans-resveratrol in humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Trans-Resveratrol has been used in the form of micronized formulation, which is better absorbed, has strong antioxidants effects, is more effective than plain resveratrol formulations and is circulated on the market as a food supplement. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a stilbenoid and a phytoalexin produced by several plants. NAFLD is an increasing clinical problem involving the liver for which effective treatments are required. The present study was based on two patient groups. The study, which commenced on April 2013 and finished on April 2015, included 44 patients, aged 29-70 years, with an average weight of 84.6 kg (n=22 per group; 28 men and 16 women) who were randomly assigned to groups and given 50 mg Evelor capsule (n=22) and 200 mg Evelor H tablet (n=22) correspondingly on a daily basis. The patients were followed up for 6 months. Quantity fat measurements, with ultrasound on the liver and kidney, were carried out. There was an initial measurement (time 1) and one after six months (time 2). The study results showed the effects of Trans-resveratrol micronized formulation in reducing the liver fat, as well as decreasing hepatic enzymes, serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (g-GT) and insulin resistance. At the end of the study, the statistical analysis showed a statistically significant reduction on the liver fat. These data demonstrate that use of Trans-resveratrol micronized formulation improves features of NAFLD, and prevents liver damage. Thus, Trans-resveratrol micronized formulation can be a new treatment method for NAFLD.

Health Benefits of Resveratrol in Kidney Disease: Evidence from In Vitro and In Vivo Studies
Danja J. Den Hartogh and Evangelia Tsiani

In another randomized, double-blinded study by Lin et al., low-dose (150 mg/day) or high-dose (450 mg/day) of RSV intake for 12 weeks by peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients resulted in significant improvements in mean net ultrafiltration (UF) volume and rate (Table 9) [113]. ... in the study by Lin et al. [113] administration of 450 mg RSV/day for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvements and health benefits, suggesting that longer duration of administration of a specific dose of RSV (450 or 500 mg/day) may be required to see/elicit beneficial effects.

In a randomized, double-blinded study by Brasnyo et al. (2011), oral administration of RSV (10 mg/day) in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) individuals (following the WHO diagnostic guidelines), significantly increased insulin sensitivity and reduced serum glucose and cholesterol levels [116]. In addition, RSV treatment significantly reduced serum creatinine levels and maintained GFR, suggesting improved kidney function [116]. In a similar randomized, open-label, controlled study, administration of RSV (250 mg/day) for 4 months in T2DM patients (3 year duration of T2DM and minimum 6 months oral hypoglycemic treatment) resulted in significantly improved lipid profile, with reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride levels [117]. Serum creatinine, urea nitrogen levels, and total protein excretion were reduced with RSV treatment, suggesting improved kidney function [117]. These studies [116,117] show that treatment of individuals with T2DM and impaired kidney function with RSV resulted in improved glucose, insulin, and lipid homeostasis and better kidney function.

Resveratrol's Potential in the Adjunctive Management of Cardiovascular Disease, Obesity, Diabetes, Alzheimer Disease, and Cancer.
Review article
Kulashekar M, et al. J Am Osteopath Assoc. 2018.

Another study identified calorie restriction mimicking of resveratrol in obese men in a clinical trial.18 The men were given 150 mg of resveratrol per day orally for 30 days, and metabolic profile and energy metabolism were measured. Similar to the obese rat study,16 this study showed a reduction in levels of hepatic lipids, plasma glucose, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers, along with a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Assessment of whole-body energy expenditure, substrate utilization, ectopic lipid storage, mitochondrial function, and lipolysis revealed that resveratrol helped lower energy expenditure and improve metabolic and general health parameters.18 These results suggest that resveratrol mimics calorie restriction without reducing actual calorie intake, which would render it a more easily compliant method of treatment for patients with metabolic syndrome. 

Many articles have been published in the past several years that cover resveratrol's potential health benefits in diabetes mellitus in both human and animal studies.17,19-24 These articles also explore the protective effects resveratrol seems to exert against serious consequences associated with the disease, including loss of kidney function,19,20 poor cardiac health,21,24 and retinal degeneration.22,23 
A clinical study published in 201217 investigated the effects of resveratrol on glycemic control and other risk factors also associated with the disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were given resveratrol (250 mg/d) in addition to their regular hypoglycemic agents and were compared with patients who took only those agents. The resveratrol group had a significant decrease in hemoglobin A1c, along with a reduction in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and total protein compared with the control group. The cardiovascular benefits observed are not surprising, as diabetes mellitus is known to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that resveratrol added to a regular hypoglycemic regimen can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and may be a potential adjunctive therapeutic agent in the management of this disease.17 


To investigate the safety and tolerability of resveratrol in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, AD, a phase II trial analyzed AD biomarkers and other clinical endpoints in human participants with mild to moderate AD treated for 52 weeks with escalating doses of resveratrol starting at 500 mg per day.30 Compared with placebo, resveratrol appeared to stabilize the decline in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of Aβ40 expected with advancing dementia. Also, in patients with biomarker-confirmed AD (ie, CSF Aβ42 levels lower than 600 ng/mL at the start), resveratrol stabilized those levels. Resveratrol also blunted the decrease in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scores during the 52-week period. Additionally, the resveratrol group showed a decrease in brain volume (excluding CSF, the brainstem, and the cerebellum) and an increase in ventricular volume, suggesting that resveratrol exerts powerful anti-inflammatory actions that result in decreased brain edema. These findings were more pronounced in a subgroup of patients who were apolipoprotein ε4 gene carriers than in a subgroup of patients who were not carriers of the gene. Although interpretation of these results remains unclear, all of the resveratrol doses were safe and well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being nausea and diarrhea.30 These findings call for more research into how resveratrol's pharmacology and administration can be altered to improve its effects in humans with AD. 
Conclusion
Numerous preclinical experiments and clinical trials in humans have shown resveratrol to have the potential for therapeutic use in disease states such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, AD, and cancer. Resveratrol has been found to be safe and reasonably well tolerated in humans, with only mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse effects being reported, even at relatively high doses.14,30 Resveratrol is easily obtained through dietary substances such as supplements (see the Table for recommended doses), but its systemic (plasma) bioavailability in vivo following metabolism has been reported as notably low when compared with concentrations that typically produce statistically significant effects in vitro.14,38 Conceivably, as observed in vivo in the liver and kidney,39 resveratrol may accumulate over time up to concentrations several times higher than seen in plasma in the various target tissues discussed in this review, ie, up to levels often observed in vitro. Further investigation is important to facilitate the translation of experimental findings in vitro into human benefits in vivo.37,41",1,1577203848,longevity

,geneticfreaked,"It is worth noting now that this is a very undeveloped area of study and the data for this is unreliable and possibly just a correlation as it may be due to other differences in ethnicity etc so don’t take any of what I say as the truth. The data I looked at was mainly for people at altitude, they experience a constant low oxygen environment though, rather than just one that you hop in and out of.

From what I’ve found sleeping in such a tent would be far less efficient than not as you wouldn’t be in a constant environment of low oxygen and wouldn’t be acclimatised. This would mean that either you would have to spend longer sleeping or that you’d suffer the effects of lack of sleep which would decrease your health and longevity. It might be better actually to spend the day in the tent and sleep normally as exercise at low oxygen can be beneficial. 

It would absolutely be bad to do it if you’re pregnant. It can have sever effects on the development of the child and wouldn’t be good for the mother either so bare that in mind. 

Low oxygen environments however can reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, certain types of cancer, and respiratory tract infections. It comes with the risk however that you would experience possibly higher risks of death/injury should you have one of these due to a lack of physical activity since it would be more tiring to move due to the low oxygen. 

Personally I’m not gonna say either way, there’s a lot of variables and little certainty, it would depend on how long you actually spent in the tent as only sleeping in one would mean that you never fully acclimatise to the lack of oxygen. 

There are certainly possible benefits but whilst it has some chance of increasing your lifespan, the effect it would have on your quality of life would probably be fairly drastic so I would not recommend! Cardiovascular disease and strokes are the biggest killers in most middle-high income countries though so who knows.

[Creatine in mouse models of neurodegeneration and aging (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21390530)

&gt; As aging and neurodegeneration share pathophysiological pathways, we investigated the effect of oral creatine supplementation on aging in 162 aged wild-type C57Bl/6J mice. The median healthy life span of creatine-fed mice was 9% higher than in their control littermates, and they performed significantly better in neurobehavioral tests.
In brains of creatine-treated mice, there was a trend toward a reduction of reactive oxygen species and significantly lower accumulation of the ""aging pigment"" lipofuscin. Expression profiling showed an upregulation of genes implicated in neuronal growth, neuroprotection, and learning. These data showed that creatine improves health and longevity in mice. Creatine may, therefore, be a promising food supplement to promote healthy human aging.
However, the strong neuroprotective effects in animal studies of creatine have not been reproduced in human clinical trials (that have been conducted in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The reasons for this translational gap are discussed. One obvious cause seems to be that all previous human studies may have been underpowered. Large phase III trials over long time periods are currently being conducted for Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, and will possibly solve this issue.

ARCH-backed biotech emerges with $85M and a bold claim: A new hu­man hor­mone can re­verse a key ef­fect of ag­ing

The el­der­ly pa­tient’s mus­cles didn’t look right be­neath the mi­cro­scope.


Russ Cox
He wasn’t just old. He had di­a­bet­ic my­opa­thy, a com­pli­ca­tion where mus­cles de­grade faster than nor­mal. The mi­to­chon­dria die, fibers weak­en, and the tis­sues be­come so bro­ken up they re­sem­ble cracked Dust Bowl earth. “Like cot­tage cheese,” of­fers Russ Cox, a Genen­tech and Jazz Phar­ma al­umn.

But now they looked — healthy. Mi­to­chon­dria were fir­ing. The fibers perked and stretched.


“These mus­cles were re­al­ly look­ing as if they were mus­cles of a per­son 20 years younger,” Sun­deep Dugar, the J&amp;J and Bris­tol-My­ers Squibb vet on the oth­er end of the mi­cro­scope, told End­points News. 

The pa­tient and oth­ers had been in­ject­ed with a form of fla­vanol, the metabo­lites found in grape skins and wine and dark choco­late that lead nu­tri­tion­ists to some­times rec­om­mend those foods for heart health. It’s con­sid­ered an an­tiox­i­dant. But the re­sults that Dugar and his col­lab­o­ra­tor George Schrein­er saw, along with ear­li­er an­i­mal stud­ies, led them to a bold idea: Fla­vanoid was ac­tu­al­ly fol­low­ing bi­o­log­i­cal path­ways nor­mal­ly used by a yet undis­cov­ered hu­man hor­mone, the first of its kind dis­cov­ered in over 50 years.

“It’s a big deal,” Dugar said. “I think it’s a big deal.”

That was in 2012. Dugar, Schrein­er and Cox are now form­ing a com­pa­ny called Epir­i­um around that find­ing and the sub­se­quent work they did con­firm­ing the new hor­mone. It’s a re­jig of an old­er, poor­ly fund­ed group the trio had worked on called Cardero, but now they’ve man­aged to con­vince a fleet of topflight in­vestors: Lon­gi­tude, Arch, Ver­tex and Adams Street have joined in an $85 mil­lion Se­ries A.

There’s al­so an in­vestor called Longevi­ty Fund, a group fo­cused on ex­tend­ing hu­man life, and Arch head Bob Nelsen has made no se­cret of his de­sire to live for­ev­er. The two hint at an idea the new biotech isn’t par­tic­u­lar­ly shy about: That while they will be­gin with tri­als in rare neu­ro­mus­cu­lar dis­or­ders, name­ly a form of mus­cu­lar dy­s­tro­phy called Beck­er’s, they have am­bi­tions that are much broad­er.

“They made the in­vest­ment not just be­cause they think we can do some­thing mean­ing­ful in Beck­er’s mus­cu­lar dy­s­tro­phy, but pri­mar­i­ly be­cause some of these larg­er dis­eases could ben­e­fit as well,” Cox, the CEO, told End­points. “There’s no ques­tion we will evolve.”

Epir­i­um isn’t yet re­veal­ing what their claimed new hor­mone is. They say the long de­lay has been in try­ing to se­cure the in­tel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty and that a sci­en­tif­ic pa­per is com­ing ear­ly next year.

It has to do, though, with mi­to­chon­dria bio­gen­e­sis, or the cre­ation of new mi­to­chon­dria. These or­ganelles are of­ten called the ‘en­gine of the cells’ but they break down with age or with cer­tain dis­eases and bring the mus­cles down with them. Ex­er­cise is one of the on­ly ways to make more.

“You and I lose 10% of our mi­to­chon­dria every decade, so by the time you get to my age, you’re un­der­wa­ter as op­posed to when you’re 18,” said Cox, a for­mer track and cross coun­try ath­lete now ap­proach­ing 60.

Dugar and Schrein­er, who worked at Scios be­fore it was bought by J&amp;J for $2.4 bil­lion in 2003, had been en­list­ed at UC San Diego to in­ves­ti­gate why fla­vanol had bi­o­log­i­cal ef­fects. To emerge from that re­search claim­ing to find a new hu­man hor­mone is bold, par­tic­u­lar­ly with­out pub­lish­ing the work. Re­searchers have long stud­ied fla­vanol for its car­dio­vas­cu­lar im­pact with­out ar­riv­ing at sim­i­lar con­clu­sions. The hor­mone would be the first mi­to­chon­dr­i­al steroid in 50 years, they said.

“Of course, they all went to google it, and couldn’t find a pub­li­ca­tion on it and said ‘how can that damn b?'” he said.

Epir­i­um will start out with a clin­i­cal tri­al on Beck­er’s mus­cu­lar dy­s­tro­phy pa­tients, one of the groups they stud­ied in the ear­ly proof-of-con­cepts. Beck­ers’ is akin to a less dev­as­tat­ing form of Duchenne’s. When pa­tients’ mus­cles fire, they re­lease tox­ins that kill mi­to­chon­dria and de­plete over­all mus­cle tis­sue. Cox said their hor­mone should be able to slow or even re­verse that mus­cle loss.

Beck­er’s may seem an odd start­ing point giv­en the gene ther­a­pies near­ing mar­ket for mus­cu­lar dy­s­tro­phy, but Cox said that their hor­mone might be used in com­bi­na­tion with the flashier ap­proach.

Abstract:

&gt; Dim-light-at-night (DLAN) exposure is associated with health problems, such as metabolic disruptions, immunological modulations, oxidative stress, sleep problems, and altered circadian timing. Neurophysiological parameters, including sleep patterns, are altered in the course of aging in a similar way.  

&gt; Here, we investigated the effect of chronic (three months) DLAN exposure (12L:12Dim-light, 75:5lux) on sleep and the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), and rest-activity behavior in young (6-month-old, n=9) and aged (18- n=8, 24-month-old, n=6) C57BL/6J mice and compared with age-matched controls (n=11, n=9 and n=8, respectively). We recorded the EEG and electromyogram continuously for 48-h and conducted a 6-h sleep-deprivation. A delay in the phase angle of entrainment of locomotor activity and daily vigilance state rhythms was apparent in mice following DLAN exposure, throughout the whole age spectrum, rendering sleep characteristics similar among the three age DLAN groups and significantly different from the age-matched controls. Notably, slow-wave-activity in NREM sleep (SWA, EEG power density in 0.5-4.0 Hz) was differentially altered in young and aged DLAN mice. Particularly, SWA increased as a function of age, which was further accentuated following DLAN exposure. However, this was not found in the young DLAN animals, which were characterized by the lowest SWA levels.  

&gt; Concluding, long-term DLAN exposure induced more pronounced alterations in the sleep architecture of young mice, towards an aging phenotype, while it enhanced age-associated sleep changes in the older groups. Our data suggest that irrespective of age, chronic DLAN exposure deteriorates sleep behavior and may consequently impact general health.",1,1576696676,longevity

Abstract:

&gt; Most cancers arise in individuals over the age of 60. As the world population is living longer and reaching older ages, cancer is becoming a substantial public health problem.

&gt; In this Review, we address the role of the ageing microenvironment in the promotion of tumour progression. Specifically, we discuss the cellular and molecular changes in non-cancerous cells during ageing, and how these may contribute towards a tumour permissive microenvironment; these changes encompass biophysical alterations in the extracellular matrix, changes in secreted factors and changes in the immune system.  
&gt; We also discuss the contribution of these changes to responses to cancer therapy as ageing predicts outcomes of therapy, including survival. Yet, in preclinical studies, the contribution of the aged microenvironment to therapy response is largely ignored, with most studies designed in 8-week-old mice rather than older mice that reflect an age appropriate to the disease being modelled. This may explain, in part, the failure of many successful preclinical therapies upon their translation to the clinic. Overall, the intention of this Review is to provide an overview of the interplay that occurs between ageing cell types in the microenvironment and cancer cells and how this is likely to impact tumour metastasis and therapy response.",1,1576661832,longevity

&amp;#x200B;

**""CELLULAR SENESCENCE: A STRESS-ACTIVATED CELLULAR AGING PROGRAM WITH SYSTEMIC EFFECTS THROUGH ITS SECRETORY PHENOTYPE**  

Many aging-related stresses including telomere shortening and oxidative stress can activate senescence, an irreversible cell cycle arrest mainly modulated by the p53/p21 and p16/ Rb pathways (Campisi, 2013; He and Sharpless, 2017; Kuil­man et al., 2010; Munoz-Espin and Serrano, 2014). In ad­dition, senescent cells display several other phenotypic alter­ations including altered metabolism, senescent hypertrophy, and extensive changes in gene expression characterized by a massive secretory phenotype called the senescence-associ­ated secretory phenotype (SASP) or senescence messaging secretome (SMS) (Acosta et al., 2008; Coppe et al., 2008; Kuilman et al., 2008). Senescence acts a strong tumor sup­pressive mechanism due to its growth arrest phenotype, yet recent studies indicated that senescence can affect a variety of biological processes including paracrine senescence, tissue repair, immune surveillance, chronic inflammation, and or­ganismal aging. Currently, such pleiotropic effects of senes­cent cells are believed to be mainly attributed to their secreto­ry phenotype, which has a huge impact on their neighboring cells, tissue microenvironment, and systemic regulation (He and Sharpless, 2017; Lopez-Otin et al., 2013; Munoz-Espin and Serrano, 2014).  

How does senescence cause aging and age-related pathol­ogies? There are at least two possibilities, although they are not mutually exclusive. The first one is senescence of tissue stem cells, which leads to stem cell exhaustion, the subse­quent decline of stem cells’ ability for tissue renewal, and eventually tissue deterioration and aging. Another is that if senescent cells become accumulated, at least in part, due to either decreased immune function or continuous stress stim­uli, it causes chronic inflammation through the uncontrolled activation of the SASP, which leads to tissue dysfunction and eventually aging and age-related pathologies (Gorgoulis et al., 2019; He and Sharpless, 2017; Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018). Currently, both seem to work in vivo. For example, a reduction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) repopulating capacity is well correlated with an increase of senescent HSCs. Knockout of p16INK4A, one of the key regulator of senescence, partially rescued these stem cell exhaustion and functional decline (Janzen et al., 2006). This stem cell exhaustion-driven aging phenotype is widespread for many tissues including neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and satellite cells (McHugh and Gil, 2018).  

In vivo evidence to support the second possibility mostly depends on correlative studies until recently. For example, it has been shown that there are increased levels of several SASP factors such as IL-1A and IL6 in tissues during aging. Inhibition of a key regulator of the inflammatory response (Doles et al., 2012; Pietras et al., 2016), NF-κB, delays DNA damage-induced senescence and aging in mice (Tilstra et al., 2012). The van Deursen group’s studies with the INK-ATTAC also hints how critically the SASP contributes to the aging process (Baker et al., 2011; 2016). In their system, if stem cells become a target of senescence, they will be removed by apoptosis instead of senescence and thus stem cell exhaus­tion still occurs. Despite this, the selective elimination of se­nescent cells still mitigates several age-associated pathologies and extends lifespan in mice, emphasizing that persistence of senescent cells play a major role in the aging process. It is plausible to assume that senescent cells exert cell-non auton­omous effects on neighboring cells and microenvironment, which deteriorates tissue function and eventually leads to ag­ing. A prime suspect is the SASP, which contains a variety of intercellular signaling proteins such as proinflammatory cyto­kines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases (Coppe et al., 2008). It still remains to be proved whether the SASP di­rectly drives the aging process or not and if so, how it works. As we recently gained new insights into SASP regulation (Chien et al., 2011; De Cecco et al., 2019; Dou et al., 2017; Freund et al., 2011; Gluck et al., 2017; Kang and Elledge, 2016; Kang et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2017; Tasdemir et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017), however, it is a matter of time to get solid answers for such important questions.

""**SENOLYTICS ARE A TARGETED ELIMINATION OF SENESCENT CELLS FOR DELAYING AGING AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES**  

Since senescence is firmly established to be a main causal factor for aging and genetically removing senescent cells has been shown to delay several age-associated pathologies, **3**  

it is reasonable to seek strategies to target it for enhancing health. In several respects, senescent cells are like cancer cells that do not divide, including metabolic shift, epigenetic change, and resistance to apoptosis (Campisi, 2013).

,InfinityArch,"&gt;If there were already 20 year old mice and 50 year old dogs, there would have been nothing to discuss. We would have already started clinical trials in humans and see the results.

The existence of 50 year old dogs and 20 year old mice would be a clear indication that dramatic changes to maximum lifespan can be achieved without radical alterations to the underlying biochemistry.  But the sad truth is 99% of it wouldn't translate into humans, and that's the probable fate of Unity, ResTORBio, and all of the ""aging-pharma"" companies. Nearly all them will fail, maybe a handful will bring a product to market.

That's simply how pharma is when it comes to complicated diseases of aging like cancer, and while aging isn't necessarily *that* much more complicated than cancer or Alzheimer's, I don't think we can plausibly make a case that it's any less complicated than the diseases that BioPharma struggles so much with, so we should expect failure rates comparable to or higher than drugs for cancer, heart disease, and dementia.

Right now, we have considerable evidence that the course of aging can be modified in such a way  as to compress the period of multimorbidity during which humans accrue most of their lifetime medical expenses. Any specific intervention or strategy is most likely going to fail, but a single success, even one with a plausible (and modest) effect on human health will accomplish more than dozens of successful cancer drugs in terms of the public health gains. That is why research into aging, and efforts to translate said research are worth pursuing. Hopefully over the next 20 years we will have demonstrated a clear cost/benefit advantage of aging directed drugs over the conventional approach, that's what we're all hoping for, but it's not guaranteed, because of how high the failure rates are likely to be.

&gt;George Church or Sinclair or De Grey know that, and despite that they are moving forward to curing ageing (root cause of cancers, dementia , stroke etc) instead of tackling the symptoms and getting-us-nowhere approach of last 60 years.

I would argue their assessment of the reasons for the disappointing progress in pharmaceuticals (which is exaggerated in the first place) are built on a misinterpretation of how pharmaceutical research actually works, and why we don't have cures for diseases of aging.

We aren't just treating symptoms. Our current medical system does the best it can to prevent or cure diseases pharmacologically; hence the existence of drugs like metformin and statins which respectively are used to prevent pre-diabetes from developing into diabetes, and to mitigate the risk of atherosclerosis by lowering cholesterol, along with the subset of cancers that are curable.  But prevention is difficult, and extraordinarily expensive to establish.

In terms of its translational prospects, aging research has a clear advantage in that an anti-aging intervention isn't disease specific, and can potentially ameliorate or prevent multiple age related disease states. But proving that is going to be very costly in the case of showing prevention, and there's the often overlooked problem (in these circles) of drug interactions, the more drugs you give a person the higher the probability of an adverse and potentially lethal interaction gets.

Careful dosing regimens that temporally isolate undesirable interactions can potentially avoid some of that, but as the complexity of those treatments rise the number of errors caused by human factors. Maybe you can reduce errors on the part of medical personnel with some sort of AI based dosing utility, but that's not going to help with the already considerable issue of patient non-compliance, and you still have the off-target effects of the drugs themselves to consider.",2,1576438021,longevity

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There are absolutely interventions that extend maximum lifespan in animal models. To act like maximum lifespan for a species is immutable is just not consistent with the literature.

Which isn't what I have be claiming in the first place, but I see how the way I worded my original post could cause confusion.

At the end of day, what we've observed in model organisms strongly suggests maximum lifespan is far less plastic than median lifespan. Meanwhile, the absolute amount of additional lifespan doesn't even come close to what would qualify as ""radical life extension"" in humans. The original comment in this chain predicted nobody alive today would live to be longer than 125, which is already in excess of the highest reported human lifespan of 122 by 3 years, and that particular claim (Jean Calment) is highly disputed to begin with, making that a fairly generous prediction if we are exclusively looking at what is  factually demonstrated rather than going off and making wild extrapolations.

Even if we had mice that lived to be 10 years, there's very little reason to think most of that would translate to humans, because that's just how it is with model organisms; &gt;95% of new cancer drugs fail in clinical trials, and they've all been validated to a far greater degree than any of the proposed longevity interventions in animal models prior to being cleared for human use, but at that point there would at least be plausible grounds to claim that we might be able to achieve significant (&gt;5%) gains to the human maximum lifespan.

Every area of study in biology goes through this sort of ""Honeymoon"" period when it first becomes popular. People get all excited as it seems like we're understanding more and more about a particular biological process, the data lines up beautifully, and as we're translating into model systems the results are astounding, mind blowing even. Then the first drugs enter clinical trials and the results start off mixed, as we're seeing now. The huge wave of investment passes, and there's maybe a handful of new drugs to show for it, and we once again realize how little with actually know about biology.

Maybe this time will be different. I really hope it will be, and the possibility raised by recent work that treating aging may be possible to some degree using  conventional drug development strategies makes this field worthy of further study and investment. But even achieving the same kind of slow, grinding progress against aging as we have against cancer (falling well short of a ""cure"") would be utterly transformative in terms of the impact on public health.

Multiple labs consistently report 50% survivorship of C57Bl6J mice at 28 months, 10% at 32 months, and maximum lifespan at 36 months (3 years old). This has been independently verified at multiple sites, and is the lifespan curve given by Jackson Laboratories, who have data on thousands and thousands of mice.

&gt;That's actually what the evidence suggests; in all the model animals we're playing with we've seen compression of morbidity, not changes to maximum lifespan. That being the case, any numbers past 120 are made up. They might not be wrong however, I don't think we can actually make meaningful predictions about the state of the medical field 50 years from now, much less 100 years from now.

,gordonjames62,"I would put big money betting against you.

Lets say the [world population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) is under 8 billion.

The bet would be over when 4 billion currently alive are dead.

Our current yearly death rate is around 8 per 1000 per year, or over 55 million / year.

so the math is simple divide half the population (4 billion or 4000 million) by the current yearly death rate (55 million a year)

4000 million / 55 million = 72 YEARS  for 4 billion people to die.

By the year 2091 we could falsify your hypothesis when more than 50% of the current population are dead.

The more accurate math (changing birth and death rates) puts the year closer to the year 2105, but this is still really quite soon by the standards of progress in medicine.

,InfinityArch,"No, it would require that maximum lifespan is dictated by canalization, much like all the age related diseases appear to be, canalization being the phenomena where a diverse range of genetic inputs converge to a single phenotypical output.

That's certainly not inconsistent with the literature; we have modified median lifespan a lot, quite dramatically in many cases, but without changes to maximum lifespan, or with only small improvements. Seeing as there are no 20 year old mice or 50 year old dogs, radical life extension is not worthy of serious discussion at this time.

That's not to say it can't happen. That's not even to say it won't happen in our lifetimes. I don't  actually know the answer to that question. But excessive focus on big, flashy, and highly hypothetical applications of particular research direction don't justify funding aging research as more than a curiosity. 

What does is the fact that there's robust evidence in model organisms that biological aging is to some extent druggable, and that when interventions that ameliorate aging are applied to model organisms, we observe a delay in the accumulation of multimorbidites; in other words multiple age related diseases are being treated or delayed by age directed interventions. 

That's extremely significant; it doesn't take all that big of a change to the rate of aging, or some very incomplete and limited kind of ""rejuvenation"" to dwarf the public health impact of curing cancer, heart disease, and dementia, even if it comes without any changes to maximum lifespan.",1,1576393331,longevity

Cancer is a very, very, *very* complicated phenomena which involves hundreds of genes\*. So is Alzheimer's Disease, and I'd assume that's also true of heart disease and all the other age related diseases.

In spite of that complexity and all the myriad flaws with the way we approach drug development, we've made progress against several of those diseases in the past 40 years. Grindingly slow, incremental progress, true, and it's lead to a situation where people are living longer but sicker lives, but progress nonetheless.

People who try to suggest the gains over the past decades was exclusively from reductions in smoking or lifestyle changes are wrong, and in fact a decent component of our gains to human life expectancy in the past decades has been from biomedical interventions that have reduced mid-life death rates from age related diseases.

Is aging really so much more complicated than cancer that we can't even manage that sort of slow, grinding progress? From where I'm standing I don't see any compelling evidence that it is, that was always just kind of assumed, and it seems increasingly likely that assumption was wrong. Either way, the public health impact of even modest progress against aging would utterly dwarf that of outright curing a major age related disease like cancer (which isn't a single disease in the first place).

\*  And speaking as someone who works primarily with proteins, genes are only part of the story, there's a great deal of biological information that is not and cannot be encoded into genes, hence why you can't make a cell from scratch using only its DNA, you need the proper cellular context with the right biomolecules in the right spatial arrangement.",1,1576390314,longevity

Viruses can be cured like any others, and most other issues can be tied to aging, I wouldn't consider aging 'solved' until it also accounts for things like cancer, heart disease, stroke, etc.

&gt; Human life expectancy has increased over the past 170 years in many parts of the world. Unfortunately, the healthy lifespan has not, and the period of life when a person lives with disability and illness at the end of life is growing, especially in women.

&gt; But ageing is malleable, and mounting evidence suggests that late-life ill health can be combated. In laboratory animals, including mice and rhesus monkeys, genetic, lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can increase not only the lifespan, but also the healthspan. In humans, improvements in diet and the implementation of physical exercise regimes can effect major health improvements, but better lifestyle is not enough to prevent age-related diseases.

&gt; The big hope is that 25 years from now, medical sciences will have progressed enough to enable people to have healthier and more active lives almost up until their eventual death. Going forward, the direct targeting of mechanisms of ageing, including with existing drugs, presents an opportunity to reduce disability and illness in late life. Sirolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor, extends the lifespan of laboratory animals and in clinical trials has proved to boost the immune response of older people to vaccination against influenza. Other drugs, such as the combination of desatinib and the BCL-2 inhibitor quercetin, which kill senescent cells, are farther from the clinic but show promise. Plasma from younger mice has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the stem cell function of several tissues in older mice; work to identify the natural metabolites responsible for this effect could open up avenues for translation to the clinic.

Caution: regenerative medicine at a critical juncture
Margaret Hamburg yesterday

Over the course of my medical career, I have seen the world transform. Certain things I learnt in medical school have been proven false, while other things that seemed simple then have turned out to be far more complex. And some things that are reality today would have then seemed pulled from the pages of science fiction.

Regenerative medicine wasn’t even on the syllabus, the term first being used in 1983. Defined now as “a branch of medicine concerned with developing therapies that regenerate or replace injured, diseased or defective cells, tissues, or organs to restore or establish structure or function,” this broad and evolving field boasts accomplishments that are nothing short of remarkable.

Aiming to fix the root cause of a patient’s condition, rather than just treating the symptoms, physicians today are gaining the knowledge and tools to repair damaged cells and build new body parts. Genes can be modified or introduced into the body to fight or prevent disease; a variety of cell types, such as stem cells, can be administered to patients to grow, replace, or heal tissues; and whole new organs or body components can be generated. It is amazing how rapidly advances in science and technology are being harnessed for the betterment of health.

However, as we break new barriers we must grapple with difficult issues at the intersection of science, economics, access and responsibility.

Very fundamentally, the scientific community, product developers and the regulatory authorities need to work closely together to ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of these novel therapies.

This is not simple or straightforward science. How can we better understand the underlying disease, assess the interventions, and design innovative clinical trials to test the durability and long-term outcomes of treatments? How can we develop and implement manufacturing strategies that allow products to be produced at scale, enable reliable, reproducible manufacturing capacity and are as cost-effective as possible? How can we make sure that healthcare providers and the public receive the clear, accurate information they need to use and assess these new options?

Looming large are concerns about how much regenerative medicine will cost and who is going to pay.

Healthcare systems and insurers are already reeling from some recent product introductions. Few of us would have anticipated million-dollar therapies — close to the pricetag on the first FDA-approved gene therapy for an inherited disease, a treatment for retinal dystrophy, a form of blindness.

Clearly, access to novel therapies matters to patients but should they be bound by the size of their bank accounts?

Yet the reality is that even when a health system or insurer covers the price, one way or another everyone pays, whether in increased premiums, greater costs to the system or higher taxes.

Less obvious is how innovation may suffer if we do not figure out ways to both reduce costs and develop sustainable funding mechanisms. R&amp;D investment may flounder if there is marked uncertainty about who will pay.

&gt; Access to novel therapies matters to patients but should they be bound by the size of their bank accounts?

As the promise of regenerative medicine gains prominence, we also have to be wary of charlatans cashing in by offering unproven therapies to patients who are in desperate search of treatment.

Rogue stem cell clinics, for example, are rampant around the world. Patients are harmed, their money is wasted and the associated risks to health could undermine confidence in appropriately developed products and support for the field more broadly.

In the arc of medical progress, these are still early days for regenerative medicine. It is a time to take stock of where we are and assess the path forward. The enormous potential for breakthroughs in treatment and care is evident but we must move forward with deliberation and rigour so that society can truly benefit.

,InfinityArch,"Longevity is still increasing in some developed countries like Canada despite already having a high life expectancy, and if I’m not mistaken more generally in high income cohorts. The proximal causes of longevity declines in the US in particular are related to large scale failures of public health when it comes to addiction, unequal access to care, and poor mental healthcare infrastructure.

Certainly current trends don’t point to any acceleration in the rate of life expectancy increase, but there are also no (proven) aging targeted interventions in the clinic currently, so current trends don’t reflect the affect of interventions against aging on public health. 

There is a solid scientific foundation for treating aging being possible, and enough legitimate companies trying to develop drugs for longevity coming at the problem from a large enough variety of approaches that the statistical likelihood of one or more of those companies succeeding in getting a drug product to market within the next 10 to 20 years is fairly high even by the abysmally high failure rates of drug development. 

I can report anecdotally that regulators seem more open to the idea of giving aging a regulatory status that would allow drugs to be developed and prescribed for it, even if I doubt it will ever actually be called a diseases. Meanwhile, regardless of the results the TAME trial is taking the first steps towards establishing a rigorous, evidence based endpoint for “anti-aging” interventions.

At this point, at least in my opinion, barring a sudden reversal of fortunes for the whole fundamental scientific realities about aging are what will dictate the outcome of our current and future efforts to treat aging.

Fundamentally “Longevity Escape Velocity” to happen, several current uncertain scientific questions must have pari year answer.

Firstly longevity interventions, at least those targeted against different pathways must generally interact cooperatively instead of combining in ways that do more harm than good or exhibiting diminishing returns. 

There’s relatively few studies that directly address of how the various proposed interventions against aging interact with one another, even fewer in mammals, and none in primates. The ones I know of all show additive or even super-additive effects, but I don’t really put much stock in them given how sparse are and the lack of replication in humans.

Mechanistically, this kind of kinetic could be explained if, as Aubrey De Grey suggested at LEAF’s conference earlier this year, some longevity pathways may be better than they strictly need to be for an organism’s lifespan due to being selected for on the basis of something other than a species’ optimal lifespan. The scarcity of diseases other than cancer conclusively linked to somatic mutations certainly supports the idea that this could be true in at least some cases.

Meanwhile the human body (and living things in general) has enormous regenerative potential that goes unused in the form of the developmental pathways that build the body in the first place. It’s conventionally been thought that said pathways are inactive chiefly as a safeguard against cancer, and thus that it would be all but impossible to safely “tap” said pathways without causing cancer or terratomas. The second part of that orthodoxy at least is being challenged by more recent work with telomerase and reprogramming factors in mice, which are considerably MORE prone to developing cancer than humans are, evidenced (I’m being tongue in cheek here) by the number of things the state of California claims causes cancer that we expose ourselves to in everyday life with no apparent harm. So the trade off between regeneration and cancer doesn’t seem nearly as insurmountable, at least in the short term, as it once did.

Of course even if both of those things are true, we may simply compress morbidity without increasing lifespan. That’s most likely what the first longevity drug will accomplish “healthy aging”, and an increase in the median lifespan, but little to no change to maximum lifespan.

You can only compress morbidity and increase median lifespan so far however before it converges with maximum lifespan, so at some point cumulative longevity interventions will need to start affecting maximum lifespan or begin exhibiting diminishing returns.

Now, even if we do succeed in raising maximum lifespan dramatically without fully addressing aging, say to 150, we are then presented with the problem of not knowing when people are going to start dying again or what will kill them beyond what we can infer from biomarkers. 

That’s a good problem to have I think, but I expect it would frustrate further increases to life expectancy, especially given the diseases we’d be facing might be completely novel.",1,1575920822,longevity

I'd rather researchers we're honest with us about what's known and what's not and let us make our own decisions.   The substances he's advocating for are well tested and have been around a long time. From a safety perspective, wherever they end up being effective is something week have to wait and see.   I'm not waiting 70 years to see if humans so end up having increased health span. There's risk in inaction as well. Opportunity cost is real, maybe you're 25 and have the luxury of time. 

Spare us the hyperbole, 0.3% gains are not what the community is excited about. It's very statistically relevant increases across a variety of treatments, TRE, IF, Metformin, NAD boosters, Senolytics, Sauna, Sulphorophane, Rapamyicin, etc...

Only one of seven treatments Aubrey de Grey PhD proposed is necessary for indefinite youth and good health. Stem cell research is heavily funded, meanwhile at least one of the seven SENS points, are completely without funding. And its a biggie, the removal of the hTERT gene and ALT mechanism in as many tissues as possible, such that when you kill off 99% of cancer cells they lack the telomeres to return, then being copies of the 1% most resistant to whatever drug(s) you used. With forced apoptosis of the slight increase in healthy cells that get short telomeres (Another of the seven treatments) and stem cell replenishment, you then cure cancer. But even forced apoptosis is rather underfunded, even though that happens to be the treatment to age-related weakening of the immune system, for example.

If a random nuclear DNA change is good, it spreads in the population, if makes no difference, it spreads a little bit over time, if its bad, that genetic mutation will eventually get culled from the population.

“Metformin is a terrible approach to slowing aging in comparison to, say, mTOR inhibition. Slowing aging in this way, by manipulating the operation of an aged cellular metabolism without repairing the underlying damage that causes aging, is in turn a terrible approach to the treatment of aging. Yet metformin attracts a great deal of interest. I believe that most people simply don't care about effect size and reliability. Most popular science materials don't discuss these points, thus putting every intervention on the same footing in the minds of much of the public. Yet effect size and reliability are the very heart of the matter.

The animal data on metformin shows it to be unreliable when it comes to effects on life span; results from different studies and different groups are quite varied. The one large human study to examine mortality and life span looked at people with type 2 diabetes, not healthy individuals. It is known that metformin disrupts the operation of mechanisms needed for benefits to health to arise from regular exercise - a significant issue. Lastly, even if taking the human data at face value, the effect size is really just not large enough to care about. Nothing in the research noted here changes any of this.”",1,1575501624,longevity

If people are of average health and of average markers and asymptomatic, beyond vaccination and screening of proven benefit for the average person traditional medicine offers little. Until aging itself is considered a disease with proven treatments of benefit in humans (with randomized controlled studies) a traditional medicine background won’t prepare you or back you if you advocate potential but unproven treatments. PHD’s/researchers will first come up with potential mechanisms, with conflicting and confounding advice of uncertain applicability to humans (eg. david sinclair), and will prompt human studies eventually which may prove certainly and widely beneficial. For now naturopaths may have the most leeway in advocating possible beneficial “over the counter” treatments (nmr, reveristrol, ppq, whatever…). PHDs will advance the science. Md’s will implement the proven therapys when they are available, but that may be a while. When supplements or gene therapy are of accepted benefit physicians will implement them en mass, but not before.

&gt; Oral and poster presentation entitled “Nature-Made Catalytic Antibody Platform: From Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle to the Brink of Medical Interventions.” at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Experimental Biology Conference, April 9, 2019, Orlando.

Abstract: 

&gt; Quantum mechanics-based design of useful catalytic antibodies (catabodies) failed because of the
uncertain structure of the dynamic catalyst-substrate complex. The Catabody Platform emerged
from discovery of beneficial germline gene catabodies that hydrolyzed self-proteins by transient
covalent pairing of the strong catabody nucleophile with a weak target protein electrophile.
Catabodies have evolved by Darwinian natural selection for protection against misfolded selfproteins that threatened survival by causing amyloid disease. Ancient antibody scaffolds
upregulate the catalytic activity of the antibody variable (V) domains. Healthy humans universally
produce beneficial catabodies specific for at least 3 misfolded self-proteins, transthyretin, amyloid
β peptide and tau protein. Catabody are superior to ordinary antibodies because of catalyst reuse
for thousands of target destruction cycles with little or no risk of causing inflammation, a must for
non-toxic removal of abundant targets such as amyloids. Library mining with electrophilic target
analogs (ETAs) isolates therapy-grade catabodies (fast, specific). Ex vivo- and in vivo-verified
catabodies specific for the misfolded protein are available to dissolve brain, cardiac and vertebral
amyloids. Immunization with ETAs overcomes important ordinary vaccine limitations (no catabody
induction, poor immunogenicity of key target epitopes). We conceive electrophilic longevity
vaccines that can induce catabody synthesis for long-lasting protection against amyloid disease. 

Highlights:

&gt; * Humans produce amyloid-destroying catabodies as a natural defense against aging  
&gt; * Electrophilic target analogs (ETAs) were used to isolate therapy-grade catabodies  
&gt; * The ETAs may be developed as prophylactic longevity E-vaccines against aging  
&gt; * E-vaccines can direct the catabody response to disease-causing amyloid epitopes  
&gt; * Catabodies and E-vaccines may solve long-standing challenges in aging research

Aging is just seven processes of damage to your body, and your body consists of cells and stuff between cells, so there are only so many things to go wrong. In no particular order: 

* Cells divide when they shouldn't (cancer). 
* Cells don't divide when they should (Parkinson's, heart disease and a few others). 
* Cells refuse to die when they should (senescent cells accumulate, diabetes as an example IIRC, and age-related weakening of the immune system). 
* Stuff between cells form surplus connections. 
* The 13 mitochondrial genes get systematically destroyed (lysosome eats the ruptured mitochondrial organelles because functional mitochondria ruptures more often than less functional ones, eventually a small percentage of cells in certain tissues in particular, ends up with no working mithochondria, which changes the ATP production to pump harmful chemical substances out of the cell). 
* Nutrients experience a chemically uncommon reaction, resulting in molecules we lack the genes to digest (these ex-nutrients then end up gunking up the system both inside cells and outside cells, when its outside cells its the primary cause of alzheimers and blockages in arteries and veins). 

Which means that we only need to fix half of the damage in each type of thing every 3-4 decades, to remain young in good health (every 3-4 decades gives you plenty of time you improve the treatments). Hence why the authors of the book Ending Aging, thinks longevity escape velocity is feasible. Meaning you can pull out of the dive towards death by aging disease, and eventually get to the point where we improve treatments quicker than we accumulate damage, and thus remain about 25 years old indefinitely.",1,1575052237,longevity

As the New York Times notes, fine-particulate pollution, defined as particles with a diameter of about one-thirtieth of a human hair, “has been linked to a range of health problems including asthma and respiratory inflammation, lung cancer, heart attack and stroke. A recent study found a significant link between air pollution and the risk of miscarriage.” The 5 percent uptick was also associated with almost 10,000 premature deaths in the two-year period — in addition to the 50,000 to 120,000 Americans that the EPA estimates die prematurely every year due to air pollution.

&gt;The natural inclination is to blame the deregulate-everything &gt;Trump administration for this very real effect of air pollution — an urge that is at least partially correct.

Sedentary lifestyle in the elderly contributes to this condition; however, physical activity improves health, reducing morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown that metformin (MTF) can also prevent muscle damage promoting muscular performance. To date, there is great controversy if MTF treatment combined with exercise training improves or nullifies the benefits provided by physical activity. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of long-term moderate exercise combined with MTF treatment on body composition, strength, redox state, and survival rate during the life of female Wistar rats. In this study, rats performed moderate exercise during 20 of their 24 months of life and were treated with MTF for one year or for 6 months, i.e., from 12 to 24 months old and 18 to 24 months old.

,WikiTextBot,"**Compression of morbidity**

The compression of morbidity in public health is a hypothesis put forth by James Fries, professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. The hypothesis was supported by a 1998 study of 1700 University of Pennsylvania alumni over a period of 20 years.Fries' hypothesis is that the burden of lifetime illness may be compressed into a shorter period before the time of death, if the age of onset of the first chronic infirmity can be postponed. This hypothesis contrasts to the view that as the age of countries' populations tends to increase over time, they will become increasingly infirm and consume an ever-larger proportion of the national budget in healthcare costs.Fries posited that if the hypothesis is confirmed, healthcare costs and patient health overall will be improved. In order to confirm this hypothesis, the evidence must show that it is possible to delay the onset of infirmity, and that corresponding increases in longevity will at least be modest.

https://www.salk.edu/news-release/researchers-report-new-methods-to-identify-alzheimers-drug-candidates-that-have-anti-aging-properties/

&gt; The group is now focusing on getting two GNPs into human clinical trials. The fisetin derivative, CMS121, is currently in the animal toxicology studies required for FDA approval to start clinical trials. The curcumin derivative, J147, is under FDA review for allowance to start clinical trials for AD early next year. The group plans to incorporate biochemical markers for aging into the clinical trials to assay for potential geroprotective effects.

&gt; Other studies in the lab are determining whether these compounds have effects on organs outside of the brain. “If these drugs have benefits for other body systems, such as maintaining kidney function and overall muscle health, they could be used in additional ways to treat or prevent the diseases of aging,” Schubert says.

&gt; The investigators say that the discovery of these AD drug candidates validates the drug discovery model they have developed as a plausible method for identifying additional GNP compounds that will help promote healthy aging. This could greatly accelerate the pipeline for drugs to treat the diseases of aging for which there are currently no cures.

We consider this to be unlikely, because we previously observed a decreased metabolic flexibility in mice on 900 mg NR per kg of diet—a dose one order of magnitude lower than the dose used in the present study. Furthermore, as was seen for high NR, 900 mg NR per kg diet increased liver weight and tended to elevate hepatic TG levels, and in eWAT significantly decreased gene expression of adipsin and did not improve pro-inflammatory gene expression (Figure S6). In addition to a possible modifying effect of the obesogenic diet, the genetic differences in mice models may also play a role.

,jimofoz,"**TAME: a genuinely good use of 75 million dollars**

“The problem with calorie restriction is that it confirms all the theories of aging” – Roy Walford (paraphrased)

In the past month (or few months, depending when you’re reading this), the news broke that the  celebrated  TAME  trial has  finally  accumulated the  funding it  needs in  order to begin.  It is  thus timely  for  me to  comment on  a  variety of  issues  around which  it has divided the (broadly-defined) gerontology community. First a little background, for the non-nerds among you. (Or, as the nerds would say it, for those  of  you  who  have  been  living  under  a  rock  for  the  past  few  years.  Perhaps  I sympathise  with  both  groups…)  The  TAME  trial  is  an  attempt  to  determine  whether metformin,  the  well-known  anti-diabetes  drug,  actually  has  much  more  wide-ranging benefits against the health problems of late life – so wide-ranging, in fact, that they could uncontroversially be described as addressing aging itself. 

First, why would we even think that metformin might do this? If it did, wouldn’t we already know, since it has been given to a massive number of people over the past decades? Well, that’s actually a big reason why the trial has been proposed: according to a recent study,1 metformin seems to extend lifespan, which is the ultimate acid test of intervention against aging.  Specifically, it  has  been  reported that  diabetics taking  metformin  live  longer, on average, than non-diabetics: in other words, that the overall benefit of metformin is  not just non-zero, it actually outweighs the harm done by diabetes. 

So far so good. But then, hang on, metformin is an old drug. I mean, a really old drug – it has been off patent since forever. There is no way in hell to make money out of it. So, how would we fund a clinical trial of it? Well, yes: the only way is philanthropic. This will only happen if there are people out there who are sufficently convinced of the importance of such a trial that they will pony up the requisite capital even though doing so is completely bereft of financial upside.

A tall order, right? But the logic is persuasive in another way: precisely because metformin is such an old drug, a  trial can immediately focus on efficacy, in contrast to the need for stringent tests of safety to come first in the case of a new drug. And, sure enough, pretty much as soon as the idea of such a trial was formulated, nearly half of the required $75M was pledged  by the long-standing supporter of  gerontology research, Paul Glenn, via  (as has  long  been his  custom) the  American Federation  for  Aging Research  (AFAR). At  that point,  however,  the  pursuit  of  funds  stalled  for  a  couple  of  years  –  in  particular,  the National Institute on Aging twice rejected applications for the remaining money – but, as noted above, the remaining support materialised very recently, courtesy of an anonymous donor. A question remains, however: is this, in fact, the best use of $75M in the crusade against aging? Well, that’s a few times the total amount that SENS Research Foundation has raised in its entire history, so it will not surprise you that I cannot quite look you in the eye and answer that  question in the affirmative. But  it is certainly not a  waste of money either: indeed, I do feel able to declare that it is a pretty good use. Here’s why.

First,  I  think  there  is  a  reasonable  chance  that  the  trial  will  succeed,  albeit  modestly. There’s no way that a brief course of metformin will give people a decade of extra life, but all that’s really needed here is a statistically significant improvement versus controls, and with that kind of money the study can be powered well enough to achieve that threshold, even with a really small difference between the means of the groups. And in terms of the impact  on  sentiment within  big pharma,  as regards  investing  in  the discovery  of future such drugs, the value of proving the principle that aging can be modified in humans – even a little bit – could be very great. 

The other rationale for this trial is arguably even greater. It is that the description of the trial incorporates a de facto definitition of aging as the clinical endpoint, which has been more-or-less  approved by  the FDA,  and which  can  thus  be copied  and  pasted  into any future  trial for  an  intervention  against  aging.  That  endpoint was  the result  of  a highly arduous negotiation with the FDA that was led by the inestimable Nir Barzilai, who is also the  PI  of  the  trial.  The  challenge,  which  had  defeated  gerontologists  for  decades previously,  was  to  find  a  formula  that  combined  two  goals:  it  had  to  be  one  that gerontologists could accept as  being  “aging  in  all  but  name,” and  it  also had to be  one which the  FDA  could accept  as being  sufficiently  objectively measurable  to constitute  a criterion  for  success  or  failure.  The  solution  is,  well,  messy…  but  it  works.  It  is  a combinatorial  definition  that  incorporates  a  plethora  of  components  that  are  each, individually,  uncontroversial  by FDA  standards,  but that  also  encapsulates  the essential fact of the crosstalk between the multiple processes that contribute to our late-life decline in function. 

One might argue that since this definition of the trial endpoint is already a done deal, we don’t actually need to shell out the money to make the trial actually occur. But that’s not really the case: realistically, the only way that big pharma are really going to believe that aging  is  now  something  for  which  the  FDA  will  approve  a  treatment  is  if  they  follow through and actually do it once. 

So I  wish the TAME  trial the best  of luck.  Metformin is  definitely not the  Holy  Grail, but there  is  a  pretty  good  chance  that  the  demonstration  of  its  broad  impact  on  late-life decline  in health  will  prove  to be  the  vehicle  that  gets  the  regulatory  authorities, and thence  the  medical  industry,  past the  conceptual  error  that  has  for  so  long  held  back commercial efforts to bring aging under true medical control.

&gt; Blood Flow Restriction Training has attracted an increasing amount of attention in the last 5-10 years in the US. However, work has focused on rehabilitation from musculo-skeletal injuries and improvement in strength and fitness for Olympic and Professional athletes. We recognize that regular exercise and good nutritional practices are the “medicines” for health and fitness. We can take the lessons from Olympians and incorporate them into our busy lives. We know that regular exercise mitigates the effects of many chronic diseases, but to do so, requires “doses” of exercise that many find impossible to do on a regular basis. Alas, there are a million reasons why we don’t incorporate regular exercise into our busy lives. BFR Training is well suited to providing “doable”, safe and effective, robust exercise in a short period of time (15 to 20 minutes), anywhere, anytime for all age groups. Regular BFR Training is the solution for many of the chronic health problems of the nation. Some call it “anti-aging” medicine.

She explicitly told me that if myself or a loved one gets cancer to get it genotyped privately in the US (ie pay for it out of pocket) then to return to canada with the results where as a citizen they must give you the best standard of care.

This is surely anecdotal, but I dont know many better sources than the MD geneticist who does this for a living, my lab manager is also a scientist in genetics and cellular biology. This is just an illustration of the still current loop holes and infeasibilities of many current advances. This is from a socialized medicine country.

Also pro tip fellow canadians: unless things have changed extremely recently, pay to genotype your cancer if you can afford it. Then come back to canada for the proper standard of care as long as it exists in our system.

This is not a polemic against the health care system, although I could launch a very vicious polemic. Mostly it's that wonderful capitalist ideology everyone absolutely loves (/s). I could launch a vicious polemic on that as well. Frankly dont expect life extension for most people under a capitalist system unless we reach post scarcity.

Not necessarily either, in fact I can put a rather hard ""no"" on the latter. There's very little reason to think that 120 is an absolute, insurmountable limit on human longevity, just the point at which the hazard rate becomes so high that someone living significantly longer that is exceedingly improbable.

Now, it's true that in model organisms, we've often increased median lifespan without doing much for maximum lifespan. That's not exactly surprising if we go by the theoretical paradigm of there being multiple largely independent mechanisms which contribute to aging; even if you can fully address a particular type of aging process, there's many, many, many more that remain unaddressed. 

But the idea that you'll just drop dead in perfect health at age 121 no matter what seems rather forced to me; (maximum) lifespan almost has to start giving after a certain amount of improvement to healthspan.

At the same time though, you're made of flesh and blood, and even if we can really and truly address aging as a whole and keep people in perfect health indefinitely, the median lifespan would ""only"" be around 1000 years, because not all causes of death are age related.",1,1570827834,longevity

&gt; The grant will support Rogers’ continuing research on the mechanisms of aging in C. elegans, a nematode worm that is a popular model in aging research because of its genetic similarity to humans and its three-week lifespan, which allows scientists to quickly assess the effectiveness of anti-aging interventions.

&gt; In his career in aging biology, Rogers has focused on the study of the genetic pathways that regulate dietary restriction (DR), or a reduction in calories without malnutrition, which science has shown to extend healthy lifespan in a wide range of organisms, from one-celled yeasts to primates such as humans.

&gt; The grant will support further research on Rogers’ earlier findings, which showed that muscle may be preferentially protected — or “privileged” — under conditions of DR. Rogers believes that DR promotes the replacement of muscle components by activating genes that control muscle structure and function.

&gt; He hypothesizes that this is nature’s way of ensuring that an organism is able to maintain the muscle strength and functionality needed to continue to forage for food in the face of a scarcity of nutrients. His discovery may have applications for the treatment of sarcopenia, or the muscle wasting that is a natural part of aging.

&gt; “One of the greatest health risks of aging is frailty, which is caused by loss of muscle mass and integrity,” Rogers said. “By gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms by which muscle tissue is maintained under conditions of DR, we can inform efforts to develop drugs that promote the function and maintenance of skeletal muscle with age.”

&gt; The grant will leverage powerful, state-of-the art genetic tools, many developed in Rogers’ laboratory, to further elucidate muscle-specific responses to DR, which are not well understood.",1,1570824172,longevity

By that I mean, I think that a better way to look at time spent ""working"" is ""will this bring me further along my path to living a healthier &amp; longer life"". Even if it's indirect, e.g. working in an un-related research field to learn the basics of research or working in a high-paying field to get capital and know investors.

Longevity (or even worst, immortality) as a goal in life is rather meh~ish, I'd much rather strive for things like having friends I trust and mutually care about, seeing awesome things and meeting interesting people or achieving some sort of self-fulfillment via introspection (which I think can be viewed from a purely agnostic/atheist perspective). 

I think this is actually beneficial for longevity because:

a) Focusing on longevity might make you too risk adverse to benefit from innovation quickly enough, and let's be honest, there therapies are likely going to be somewhat high-risk, or at least might seem so compared to the FDA-approved stuff we're used to. Genetic re-programming via viral vectors or injecting PPSCs into your thymus scarier and riskier than taking a statin.

b) Focusing on longevity might leave you with nothing to ""live life for"", which even from a longevity perspective, is actually detrimental in the long run (see loneliness/sadness and the high correlation with dying young and health issues).

c) Focusing on longevity will make other people less likely to switch their mind to focus on longevity. If you're a 60 year old mildly-rich guy with good skin that spends all times in doors avoiding the sun and taking drugs to regulate his emotions for proximal life-preserving effects... nobody want to talk to you or work with you. If you're a 60 year old in close to peak physical condition doing &lt;insert cool physical activity&gt;, talking as fluently as a 20 year old, telling stories about your years of awesome experiences and overall enjoying life you're much more likely to convert people to the cause. And, at the end of the day, the more intelligent people focus on this subject, the more likely we are to achieve it, it's not like any of the forseable therapies will be very limited by material resources.

Those are not the main reasons why I think longevity shouldn't be your life goal, but I think they are pretty relevant reasons why, ironically, even if longevity is your life goal, that's not ideal for optimizing longevity.

,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; The decline in early life mortality since the 1950s has resulted in dramatic demographic shift
towards aged population. Aging manifests as a decline in health, multiple organ dysfunction and
increased vulnerability to diseases, which degrades quality of life. A verity of genetic and
pharmacological interventions, mostly from non-vertebrate models, have been identified that can
enhance lifespan. Whether these interventions extend healthspan, the disease free and functional
period of life, has only sometimes been tested and is often a matter of debate. Human aging
indices have been developed to assess elements of functional decline with aging (e.g. sarcopenia,
cognitive function). However, corresponding comprehensive indices in mice are seldom applied
to aging studies.  
To probe the relationship between healthspan and lifespan extension in
mammals, we performed a series of longitudinal, clinically-relevant healthspan measurements.
Metabolism and aging are tightly connected and specific perturbations of nutrient-sensing
pathways can enhance longevity in laboratory animals. Here we show that alpha-ketoglutarate
(delivered in the form of a Calcium salt, CaAKG), a key metabolite in tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle
that is reported to extend lifespan in worms , can significantly extend lifespan and healthspan in
mice. AKG is involved in various fundamental processes including collagen synthesis and
epigenetic changes. Due to its broad roles in multiple biological processes, AKG has been a
subject of interest for researchers in various fields. AKG also influences several age-related
processes, including stem cell proliferation and osteoporosis.  
To determine its role in mammalian
aging, we administered CaAKG in 18 months old mice and determined its effect on the onset of
frailty and survival, discovering that the metabolite promotes longer, healthier life associated
with a decrease in levels of inflammatory factors. Interestingly the reduction in frailty was more
dramatic than the increase in lifespan, leading us to propose that CaAKG compresses morbidity.

Mental health conditions? None that I know of. But well, there's some evidence that being predisposed to *cancer* decreases your chances of developing AD. (1) This represent what I think is going to be the biggest challenge towards actually exceeding the maximum human lifespan; everything that you do to promote rejuvenation invariably promotes cancer, there's an unavoidable tradeoff between proliferation and cancer risk. 

That being said, many cancers are considerably more treatable than the degenerative diseases of aging, and our therapies against cancer are improving; you've no doubt heard about the stats on late stage melanoma treated with immunotherapies.

True, the primary endpoint of any pilot trial ( a phase I for medical devices) is to make sure that the device either causes no harm, or the risks are acceptable given the possible benefit.  On that front, treatment with the MemorEM device showed no negative effects.  However, by the most stringent measure of cognitive efficacy, the ADAS-cog test, 7 of the 8 patients showed stabilization or improvement in their scores after treatment commenced.  While just a short trial of 2 months, one would have expected a decline of about 1 point on average rather than any improvement.  I was surprised to see that 5 of the 8 experienced a 5+ point improvement which is well above normal variability and above the threshold of seeing a noticeable clinical improvement.  One of the caregivers initially didn't want to participate in the extension trial saying that his wife had improved to where she no longer got lost in their large apartment complex and didn't want to keep subjecting her to testing, blood draws and spinal taps.  I will leave you with another report that interviewed another patient and her caregiver showing the impact of TEMT on her daily life.  The quote that I think sums everything up is ""I've come back"".  We just received the first two months of cognitive data from the extension trial (where patients are around 1 year out from the start of the original trial) and I am only allowed to say that the results are ""extremely encouraging"".  Again, one would expect to see a \~5 point drop in ADAS-cog over this period so in lieu of a placebo group we will compare to the decline in large historical datasets.

I haven't read/listened to anything related to beta cell loss. Sadly most of the info on insulin and it's impact on health is being muddled by healthy people trying to cash in extra years of life.

That being said, from my knowledge of biology, and some self learning I did after a close friend was diagnosed with T2 diabetes (T2D), you should not be doomed. Specially if you are pre-diabetic since it is possible to reverse the progression of proper T2D.

A little bit of info here:

&gt; https://diatribe.org/type-2-diabetes#how-does-type-2-diabetes-progress-over-time

&gt; https://diatribe.org/type-2-diabetes#can-type-2-diabetes-be-cured

----
**Beta cells loss**

Start by asking why are those cells going away in T2D? Short version, the cells are being overworked to death. The blood sugar is high enough for long enough that the beta cells just keep churning and churning insulin like crazy. If the blood sugar wasn't high to begin with the signal harassing the cells would decrease and the cells can take a break.

T2D is not, at it's root, insulin deficiency. It's a sugar excess problem. Early stages mind you, late stage it is both. Anyway, before diagnosis or symptoms these people are not insulin deficient, nor insulin resistant or whatever. They have elevated levels of blood sugar.

Plus, if insulin resistance (by excess induced desensitization) is a factor, wouldn't giving the person even more insulin worsen the problem?

----
**Current medical approach to T2D**

By not addressing the root cause and putting a patient on insulin for life the problem is allowed to continue until the person develops starts to loose limbs and all the other know complications like nerve damage, kidney damage, slow healing, skin problems and elevated risk of infection. And what's the underlying cause of those complication? Excess blood sugar, not insulin deficiency.

If you jump on the insulin treadmill and do nothing else your beta cells will die off, your long term health will not improve and your glucose homeostasis will collapse. That encapsulates what's wrong with modern medicine.

----
**Alternatives**

If you want to preserve your beta cells for as long as possible don't abuse them. Control your blood sugar at the point of origin, diet. Consider shifting your metabolism to a substrate other than sugar. Like modified Atkins diet (rebranded as ketogenic diet), or try fasting, fasting mimetics, time restricted eating. Whatever you can stick to. Which is what matters, a persistent change in your eating habits.

And most importantly, don't wing it. You need serious, careful medical monitoring for things like this. Insulin is a tool to manage the day to day effects of diabetes. Don't dismiss it just because is has been over relayed upon by doctors for decades.

----
**Random hypothesis**

A personal hypothesis of mine. If the turnover rate of skeletal muscle is between 10-15 year, and T2D is truly a caused by insulin resistance, and insulin resistance is caused by elevated blood sugar could you cure diabetes by regulating blood sugar levels for a decade and a half? Would those insulin resistant cells be replenish by new cells that have never been exposed to high blood sugar, therefore never became resistant to insulin. Prediction, none since we don't know the mechanism behind insulin resistance, assuming it's actually a thing and not an artifact of the complexities of metabolism, or a mechanism cells have to prevent over-saturation with glucose...

&gt; Elizabeth Blackburn, a biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, who won the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, in 2009, cofounded Telomere Diagnostics in 2010. The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

&gt; Elissa Epel, another UCSF researcher who cofounded the company with Blackburn, left at the same time for the same reasons.

&gt; Both researchers told Business Insider that they questioned the efficacy of Telomere Diagnostics' test. And a former Telomere Diagnostics employee said she witnessed practices that raised doubts about the company's cleanliness, commitment to scientific accuracy, and handling of private health information.

&gt;  the links between telomere length, health, and aging are not yet clear cut.

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been tied to higher rates of disease, faster tumor growth, and overall age-related degeneration. But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal.

&gt; Aging is a progressive decline of physiological function in tissue and organ accompanying both accumulation of DNA damage and reduction of non-coding DNA. Peripheral non-coding DNA/heterochromatin has been proposed to protect the genome and centrally-located protein-coding sequences in soma and male germ cells against radiation and the invasion of exogenous nucleic acids. Therefore, this review summarizes the reduction of non-coding DNA/heterochromatin (including telomeric DNA and rDNA) and DNA damage accumulation during normal physiological aging and in various aging-related diseases. Based on analysis of data, it is found that DNA damage accumulation is roughly negatively correlated with the reduction of non-coding DNA and therefore speculated that DNA damage accumulation is likely due to the reduction of non-coding DNA protection in genome defense during aging. Therefore, it is proposed here that means to increase the total amount of non-coding DNA and/or heterochromatin prior to the onset of these diseases could potentially better protect the genome and protein-coding DNA, reduce the incidence of aging-related diseases, and thus lead to better health during aging.

Ignore whatever intuitive hunches you have about this research; human intuition is unreliable and in many cases worse than useless when it comes to making judgement about technical questions. Believe only what the data actually shows.

 For the most part, what we have established so far is that the mouse-like objects we call lab mice can have certain proposed indicators of biological aging reduced through pharmacological intervention, and that longevity of said mice under laboratory conditions is enhanced, and that this results are corroborated by various other model systems and our currently accepted theoretical framework of the biology of aging. Our only clinical data in humans so far as senolytics suggest that, at least in the context of OA and the specific agent used by Unity, they perform similarly to humira. That's not the start of a revolution; it still may be a worthy addition to the medical arsenal if it doesn't share the cancer facilitating side effects of humira (which arises from suppression of the immune system), and there is a theoretical basis it not having that side effect and perhaps even reducing cancer risk, but until there's data in humans supporting that all you have is a hypothesis, and it might very well have further health effects.

 At the same time, this is essentially as far as you can go without involving human subjects; this research is ready at this point, but it's important to realize that everything we've done in longevity research up to this point may very well turn out to be useless; our theory is about to make contact with reality, that dismal realm where nearly all brilliant sounding ideas go to die.",1,1567128710,longevity

[Optimism is not associated with two indicators of DNA methylation aging (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322503)

&gt; Evidence indicates associations between higher optimism and reduced risk of age-related conditions and premature mortality. This suggests optimism is a positive health asset, but research identifying potential biological mechanisms underlying these associations remains limited. One potential pathway is slower cellular aging, which may delay age-related deterioration in health. Data were from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (N=3,298) and the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS) (N=514), and included dispositional and explanatory style optimism measures.  
We evaluated whether higher optimism was associated with metrics suggestive of less cellular aging, as indicated by two DNA methylation algorithms, intrinsic (IEAA) and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA); these algorithms represent accelerated biologic aging that exceeds chronological age. We used linear regression models to test our hypothesis while considering several covariates (sociodemographics, depressive symptoms, health behaviors). In both cohorts, we found consistently null associations of all measures of optimism with both measures of DNA methylation aging, regardless of covariates considered. For example, in fully-adjusted models, dispositional optimism was not associated with either IEAA (WHI:β=0.02; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]:-0.15-0.20; NAS:β=-0.06; 95% CI:-0.56-0.44) or EEAA (WHI:β=-0.04; 95% CI: -0.26-0.17; NAS:β=-0.17; 95% CI: -0.80-0.46).

,DrOliverZolmanMBBS,"Have a reply from them: 

**Hey, Is the correlation with chronological age important?**

Yes. The correlation is analyzed according to Dr. Horvath’s original paper here [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015143/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015143/).

**Is the sample the epigenetic age of whole blood or PBMCs?**

If you submit blood sample, the DNA that will be extracted is from the whole blood.

**What cells are measured in the urine?**

DNA that is present in the urine will be mostly from urinary tract system.

Our *my*DNAge® age prediction tests are optimized based on sample type. Based on our population studies, the performance of blood *my*DNAge® and urine *my*DNAge® is very similar (see below). However, not every test subject has the same prediction for blood and urine, this is because some individuals have different aging rate in different parts of their body. For the blood test, the DNA comes from the white blood cells, meaning it would measure the overall body immunity. On the other hand, urine test would measure more on the urinary tract health because the DNA comes from the organs encompassing the urinary system.

**What is the correlation with chronological age for your blood and urine samples? What is the error in measurement for each of blood and urine samples? Could you explain what you mean by ""error""?**

Please see this table attached:

Additionally, to increase the accuracy of the test, our *my*DNAge® age prediction tests are optimized based on sample type, either blood or urine. The DNA source coming from blood vs urine will be different in its methylation profile. Based on our population studies, the performance of blood *my*DNAge® and urine *my*DNAge® is very similar (see below). However, as explained before, not every test subject has the same prediction for blood and urine, this is because some individuals have different aging rate in different parts of their body.

The above accuracy measures are analyzed according the definition on Dr. Steven Horvath’s publication - DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Please check the publication for more information,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015143/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015143/).

* The test error, is the median absolute difference between DNAge and chronological age. Thus, a test set error of 1.9 years indicates that DNAge differs by less than 1.9 years in 50% of subjects.
* Average age acceleration is defined by the average difference between DNAge and chronological age, can be used to determine whether the DNAge of a given sample is consistently higher (or lower) than expected.

**Are there any publications on urine samples DNAge?**

Please see our poster attached in collaboration with Zymo Research to learn more about the use of urine DNAge in bladder cancer application.

**Do bacteria in the urine sample effect the result?**

The present of bacteria will not affect the result. However, when the amount of bacterial DNA is significantly higher (more than double) than the amount of host (i.e. human) DNA, we are not able to prepare the library for DNAge analysis. Our At-Home Collection Kit containing urine preservation reagent that preserving urine nuclei acids in room temperature and adding urine preservation at the time of collection inhibits bacterial growth. This is very important since urine is the best growth media for bacteria.

&gt; Inherited genetic variation influencing leukocyte telomere length provides a natural experiment for testing associations with health outcomes, more robust to confounding and reverse causation than observational studies. We tested associations between genetically determined telomere length and aging‐related health outcomes in a large European ancestry older cohort. Data were from n = 379,758 UK Biobank participants aged 40–70, followed up for mean of 7.5 years (n = 261,837 participants aged 60 and older by end of follow‐up). Thirteen variants strongly associated with longer telomere length in peripheral white blood cells were analyzed using Mendelian randomization methods with Egger plots to assess pleiotropy. Variants in TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1, and RTEL1 were included, and estimates were per 250 base pairs increase in telomere length, approximately equivalent to the average change over a decade in the general white population.  
&gt; We highlighted associations with false discovery rate‐adjusted p‐values smaller than .05. Genetically determined longer telomere length was associated with lowered risk of coronary heart disease (CHD; OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92–0.98) but raised risk of cancer (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.16). Little evidence for associations were found with parental lifespan, centenarian status of parents, cognitive function, grip strength, sarcopenia, or falls. The results for those aged 60 and older were similar in younger or all participants.  
&gt; Genetically determined telomere length was associated with increased risk of cancer and reduced risk of CHD but little change in other age‐related health outcomes. Telomere lengthening may offer little gain in later‐life health status and face increasing cancer risks.",1,1566802799,longevity

,my_stupidquestions,"I think that there could be significant benefit to more stylish or engaging media in longevity, but I'm not sure if a full-blown channel is the right idea.

I've asked around about this in an informal way and opinions seem to be a bit mixed. Some think that the science isn't robust enough yet to start appealing to the public in a wide or general sense or spending possible research dollars on empty marketing, while others think that the lack of polished advocacy is itself holding back the perceived legitimacy of the effort.

My position is somewhere in-between, although I'm also just a bystander at present (working to change that!). 

Personally I am a little bit skeptical of any sort of ""movement"" branding. That seems like a fast way to exacerbate the popular perception of longevity as a cult of snake oil gulping kooks. I generally agree with the outlook that the research developments and therapies and community etc. will ""movement-ize"" naturally once things click for more people. Something like an ""all longevity, all the time"" channel - while useful as a one-stop-shop for podcasts and videos - could end up being regarded as some unholy mash-up of an evangelism channel and an infomercial channel. 

Ultimately these channels would be more geared towards 'converts' than the populace at large, because even with the best curation – minimal advertisement of health products, mostly discussions of novel papers and companies, interviews with scientists and entrepreneurs and science/policy lessons delivered by reputable figures, maybe some high quality fiction stuff showing both possible pros and cons of the therapies being developed from very near future to some centuries out – the onslaught would be overwhelming and just a whiff of grift or overselling the current state of the science will send people packing. 

In terms of new media advocacy, my instinct is that strategically deployed high-quality pieces approaching the issue from a very gentle and open-ended place or packaged in the context of some type of sci-fi entertainment would work the best.

That said, a lot of what I've seen in terms of outreach is cringey and poorly made. As one example, take a look at the winners of the longevityfilmcompetition from last year ([https://longevityfilmcompetition.com/](https://longevityfilmcompetition.com/)). Meaning no offense to those who worked hard to submit, but the entries are...underwhelming.

Life extension has not had the same kind of media attention as artificial intelligence, but I think we are much much closer.

## Retirement

Retirement will be abolished in the sense that typical welfare programs will substitute it. There is no need for special treatment if you reach older age if older age does not entail increased incidence in health problems. This does mean that pensions will be lower and reflect amounts now used for minimum existence welfare programs to encourage people to start being productive again in a job.

## Healthcare

The current western healthcare systems is focused on corrective maintenance. We fix somebody whenever it reports it has problems. Corrective maintenance is fine in a context where the price of failure is low. In current society whenever a elderly person ‘fails’ the price of failure is positive as failure means no more healthcare and pension costs. This will change in the future as elderly start to become productive again. Failure is in these circumstances very costly. This will in turn promote preventative medicines, real-time monitoring of status and commoditization of damage removing medicines.

## Free time

This story can be nuanced based on the country, but in general free time will stay roughly the same in the long run as each country embraces these treatments (as they are probably highly profitable for countries) which in turn means that there is no change in comparative competitiveness so equal need for free time and demands for less free time.  

In the short run, countries with higher populations of people of old age will experience a decrease in health care costs and pension costs enabling more room for free time. 

## Health disruptions

People will demand new treatments further increasing healthspan after it is shown to work. The main public will expect even further increases and move from a group probably too bearish today to too hyped and overoptimistic about future treatments. Comparable to the moonhype in the 70’s.

## Human rights

A right to access to life extension medicines will be introduced. Comparable to the universal article 25 or this article could be extended to include life extension medicine.

,_Candy-O,"I'm not a doctor, but I have 2 family members who are. They both agree it's a good idea for a guy who is in otherwise good health to go on TRT if he is low.    I'm 51, and I'm on it.  It was a game changer - sex drive, energy, mood, body aches etc. all totally fixed with TRT in my case.

What's ""low"" is open to a lot of debate.  Most men in their 70s have low levels - 400 ng/dl or less and since that's a ""normal"" part of aging, a lot of docs feel it's what you should be living with. But of course you feel like shit with T levels that low, so you have to find a doc  or endocrinologist or urologist  who is up on the latest science and willing to be helpful.  There is a lot of old, weird, stigma with TRT in the medical community around hormone replacement.

Anyway,you might want to get checked, but if you say you feel fine, then they will say ""no reason to get tested""  I you go in with specific complaints, even if you are faking it just to find out, then then they eill comply.  You'd have to complain of low libido, problems maintaining erections, lethargy, mood swings, depression etc.   Another thing you can do if you live in some states is just go get the tests done yourself at a local  lab like Sonora Quest etc. (just google search to find out if a lab is in your state)

Another red herring is that the ""normal"" range is like 300ish to 1000  (depending on the lab), but that includes everyone from teenagers to old men. If you are younger with low T and your doc tells you your low  values are still within range, you have to insist that it's not ethical to deny treatment for a man who has no sex drive etc.  It can ruin your marriage etc.  You have to go by addressing the symptoms, not the lab numbers.  But then if you say you feel like shit etc, they often try to resort to pursuing mental issues. It's a catch 22  - depression can cause lack of sex drive, lethargy etc. but low T can cause all those + depression. Did I mention the negative attitude many doctors have? lol    

Once you have you results, if you are low ( 300ish or less), just try it out for 6 months to see how you feel.  Maybe try to get in the 600-800 range.  Too much is not needed, and can have possible side effects in the long run.  You might be surprised how much better you feel. 

Your doc may not be helpful, so you might have to doctor shop a bit to find someone that will prescribe.  Again, there is a real stigma against in with a lot of older docs.  They think all the shitty effects of aging are ""meant to be normal""  of course you wouldn't be on this forum if you thought like that.

 If your muscle mas, libido, energy etc. are all fine, then perhaps there is no need. But going from low to normal/high is like night and day. It makes you feel like a man again, or the way a man is supposed to feel. sounds cliche, but being strangled of testosterone is like  a slow death that creeps up on you.  Same for women and estrogen.

Finding a cool doc can be the hardest part, but once you do, you can experiment with a treatment course and see how you feel.

,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; Over the past decades, increases in life expectancy in most modern societies have raised questions about whether and to what extent individuals value possible extensions of their personal lifetime. In this vein, a new field of research emerged that investigates the determinants, concomitants, and consequences of longevity values and personal preferences for an extended lifetime across adulthood. 

&gt; Based on a review of available theoretical and empirical work, we identified 3 mindsets on the challenges and potentials of human longevity common in research as well as personal views: (a) an essentialist mindset that builds on ideal principles of an infinite life, aimed at conquering or significantly postponing a biologically determined aging process, (b) a medicalist mindset that appraises aging as being primarily based on quality of health, and (c) a stoicist mindset that associates longevity and lifetime extension with the experience of grace and meaning. 

&gt; In this regard, we submit that motivation for longevity and its behavioral consequences differ depending on what mindsets individuals adopt in a given developmental context. We suggest that mindsets of longevity motivation are embedded in personal belief systems (e.g., death acceptance) that may depend on health, and on context influences (e.g., culture). Mindsets of longevity motivation may be related to differences in health behavior and late-life preparation. We illustrate such ideas with an exploratory analysis from a cross-cultural data set. We discuss the possible implications of these mindsets of longevity motivation for the aging sciences, and with regard to individual ways of approaching old age.",2,1561672543,longevity

&gt; ""Following an infectious mosquito bite, the malaria parasite goes first to the human liver, and then moves into the blood. Here it replicates ten-fold every 48 hours inside red blood cells—it is this blood-stage of the infection that leads to illness and can be fatal,"" explains study author Simon Draper, Professor of Vaccinology and Translational Medicine at the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford. ""The malaria parasite has a protein called RH5, which must bind to a human protein on red blood cells called basigin in order to infect them. In this study, we were able to demonstrate which human antibodies effectively block RH5 from binding with basigin, thus preventing the parasite from spreading through the blood.""

&gt; The study was done as part of a clinical trial in Oxford of the first vaccine that targets the RH5 malaria protein. Until now, however, it was not clearly understood which specific antibodies could be generated by vaccination of a human volunteer and would effectively prevent RH5 from binding to red blood cells. ""When someone is vaccinated, they make many different types of antibodies against the same RH5 target,"" explains co-author and researcher Dr. Daniel Alanine. ""This study is key to understanding which specific antibodies are actually effective against malaria, and which are not.""

Then it takes a hard left turn.  The study has nothing to do with roundworms, it's all data from astronauts in orbit.  

&amp;#x200B;

Heart rate variation (HRV) is being used to judge better vs. worse health (and by extension, aging).  (Higher HRV = better)

&gt; Our previous investigation showing HRV suppression on days of high geomagnetic disturbance[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR24)  found a decrease in HRV only when daylight alternated with darkness  (above the arctic circle, there are days of complete light or darkness),  suggesting a mechanism sensitive to the alternation of light (L) and  darkness (D). The hypothesis of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception  was supported by cross-spectral analysis. Group-averaged coherence at  frequencies coincident with the geomagnetic Pc6 pulsations (periods  ranging from 10 minutes to 5 hours) differed among the three natural  lighting conditions, the association being weaker during L/L or D/D than  during D/L (P &lt; 0.000001). A light-dark-influenced magnetoreception  mechanism in humans may thus involve the Pc6 band of the magnetic field.  Only the magnetoreception in HRV VLF-component was equal throughout the  seasons, irrespective of the three natural lighting conditions,  suggesting that biological signals involving VLF, which is vital for  life, are set-up to be highly sensitive to geomagnetics. 

&amp;#x200B;

So their theory here is that magnetic fields are the culprit, but weirdly they're apparently dependent on a light-dark cycle.  

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, the conclusion (in entirety)

 

&gt;Life  on Earth is protected by the atmosphere and the magnetic field. The  Earth’s magnetic field can affect humans’ life, especially HRV indices[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR1),[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR19),[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR20),[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR21),[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR22),[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR23),[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR24),[71](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR71),[72](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR72),[73](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45387-6#ref-CR73).  We showed that the magnetic field can affect and enhance HRV indices  involved in longevity, notably during the daytime and evening, probably  in association with an elevated activity of brain’s DMN with help from  the circadian clock. Anti-aging HRV indices were significantly increased  on days of higher magnetic activity. The difference between our results  herein and those of our previous observation in a subarctic area may  relate to a difference in extent of disturbance of the magnetic field  between the two studies.

Our  results provide a start on a catalog of measurable components of aging,  and indicate what may be effective ways to slow down or even reverse the  aging process.

Their argument that changes to the DMN from changing magnetic fields (similar to TMS but 100 times weaker, TMS effective in reducing anxiety and depression) seems to boil down to: these astronauts (in an incredibly stressful situation) were feeling extra good from a natural space magnet massage, and because their EKG looked great they must've been aging slower

Citation needed for such a strong claim.   

Yes - there are hypotheses around brain insulin resistance, but there aren't any studies showing that ""keeping insulin low"" prevents Alzheimers disease.   Of course it is common sense now not to eat added refined sugar from a general health point of view - but AD is still widely considered a disease of aging.

Somewhat related: There are clinical trials investigating intranasal insulin as a treatment, but it doesn't seem promising.

&gt; Early research suggested that when taken as a nose spray, insulin could possibly improve memory and help preserve cognitive function in people with early Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.

&gt; However, recent trials showed negative results. A study investigating the impact of nasal insulin on people with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease found no benefits from the drug.

&gt; While optimism for insulin has been dampened, researchers are still trying to understand if and how insulin might be used to manage Alzheimer's disease.

Rather than providing a definitive model of risk for ARCI and cognitive decline, the Precision Aging model is meant as a starting point to guide future research.

We have issues with crime as well, though the relative scarcity of guns possibly means less fatal crime than some US cities.

The poor are disproportionately affected by adverse health outcomes despite universal health care. I'm betting if we just looked at top income earners there would be little difference. It's likely in access to services that we might see an increased lifespan amongst the lowest income quartile.

That being said, some benefits of living in Toronto re: Longetivity for low income individuals:

Universal health care is probably the biggest. Access to general practitioners, particularly in Toronto is super easy. There are literally offices and walk in clinics on every block. Access to specialists have longer wait times but in emergency situations or via hospital admissions (also fully covered) are much faster. Flu shots and most early childhood vaccinations are fully covered. Prenatal care is fully covered.

Good social support system. Again in Toronto, due to density, there is excellent access to social support, via community groups and government offices. Navigating the system could be made easier (especially for non native English speakers) but it is there and due to diversity there are usually community interpreters available. If you qualify for social assistance (or disability or a work program) you also get drug coverage and sometimes kids get dental coverage.

That's all I can think of from a health care perspective.

Basically what we know for sure is that you need to minimize inflammation, keep your metabolism as low as possible. And to have the right balance of nutrients, not too much of one kind.

This usually means not eating any sugar (insulin causes inflammation and it hightens your metabolism). Minimize carbs. intermittent fasting (keeps metabolism low). Sleep 8 hours (Keeps metabolism low and reduces inflammation).

If you limit caloric intake you also keep your metabolism into eternal ""starvation mode"" which is a sort of pseudo-hybernation mode and is shown in rodents to increase their lifespan up to 30%.

What's important to note is that what most medical experts call ""healthy"" is almost the opposite of what life sciences actually show in paper.

This is a maximization of metabolism and is also the reason why most hardcore sporters die between age 70-80 due to the damage caused by the metabolism.

,vp2013,"&gt; Scientists at the University of Texas have implicated a type of cellular stress for the first time as a player in Alzheimer's disease. And their discovery could lead to treatments for more than 20 human brain diseases including Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury. One author of the study went as far as to say the treatment that researchers used on mice to rid them of the stressed cells actually stopped Alzheimer's disease ""in its tracks.""   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The team confirmed the discovery in four types of mice that model Alzheimer’s disease, UT Health [reported](https://news.uthscsa.edu/toxic-zombie-cells-seen-for-1st-time-in-alzheimers/). “The researchers then used a combination of drugs to clear senescent cells from the brains of middle-aged Alzheimer’s mice. Such drugs are called senolytics. The drugs used by the San Antonio researchers are Dasatinib, a chemotherapy medication that is U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved to treat leukemia, and Quercetin, a natural flavonoid compound found in fruits, vegetables and some beverages such as tea.”  
&gt;  
&gt;After three months of treatment, UT Health said their findings were “exciting.” Orr said in a statement that the Alzheimer’s mice were 20 months old and had advanced brain disease when researchers started the therapy. “After clearing the senescent cells, we saw improvements in brain structure and function. This was observed on brain MRI studies (magnetic resonance imaging) and postmortem histology studies of cell structure. The treatment seems to have stopped the disease in its tracks,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The fact we were able to treat very old mice and see improvement gives us hope that this treatment might work in human patients even after they exhibit symptoms of a brain disease,” stated Nicolas Musi, the study’s first author, professor of Medicine and director of the Sam and Ann Barshop Institute at UT Health San Antonio.

,jimofoz,"“I do not remotely claim originality for the view that research into the biology of aging receives far less public funding than is merited by its potential to alleviate suffering and to contribute to prosperity. That was already a perennial, vocal assertion of the biogerontology community decades ago. But that raises a rather obvious question: why has that message fallen on such deaf ears among political decision-makers, and what can we do today to make it be better heard?

A few days ago, I had the privilege to meet for over two hours with Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, whose roles include chairing the extravagantly-named Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Long story short, she is a very influential politician. It therefore says a lot that she found such a meeting worth her time. While I cannot at this point declare that she went away imbued with a fervent passion to drive rejuvenation biotechnology forward within the corridors of power, I can certainly say that a channel for future communication has been created.

At such a juncture, it is valuable to look back at the field’s past efforts to influence political sentiment and to ask why they did not fare better than they did. By examining that history, we may be able to maximize the chances of doing better this time. Here I will highlight three such efforts: the creation of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the Longevity Dividend initiative, and the Geroscience Interest Group.

The NIA was, ostensibly, a huge step forward for the medical defeat of aging – but only ostensibly. Those who inspired it, such as the legendary gerontologist Bernard Strehler, had very much the right intentions, but in the end they were forced to compromise massively during the process, with the result that only a minuscule proportion of the NIA’s activities can genuinely be classed as biomedical gerontology. This neutering ultimately arose, I believe, from the consensus that aging was actually never going to be amenable to serious medical intervention, and thus that it would be quixotic to spend taxpayers’ money trying to develop such medicines. Where did that consensus come from? Simply from the dogma that there is a thing called “aging itself” that is in some profound sense distinct from the so-called “diseases of old age” that are amenable (in principle) to medicine. More on that below.

Decades of frustration later, in 2006, a quartet of luminaries in the gerontology world
(including, indeed, the founding head of the NIA) came together to articulate the economic case for investing more seriously in research to keep the elderly healthy. Maybe the name “Longevity Dividend” was not ideal, in view of society’s Pavlovian tendency to assume that long life means long decrepitude, and “Healthspan Dividend” might have been more powerful. But, to be honest, I don’t think that was the key reason why the effort was so spectacularly unspectacular in its impact on public policy. The main reason, I’m sure, was that the argument that investing a certain sum in this research in order to save a certain sum later on relied on the assumption of, at least, a lower bound on the probability that the sum invested would deliver the desired results in the desired timeframe. And whaddya know, not a peep was uttered by these authors, nor by anyone else, in terms of explicit statements of such a bound. The utterly predictable result was that the audience, i.e. policy-makers, continued in the conviction that the chance of such research delivering results was in fact zero – which, obviously, rendered the entire effort pointless. It doesn’t matter how many times an investment will pay for itself in the event that the investment achieves such-and-such a goal, if there is perceived to be zero chance that it will in fact achieve that goal: any number times zero is still zero.
So to the Geroscience Interest Group (GSIG). This was the brainchild of Felipe Sierra, who heads the NIA’s Division of Aging Biology, and he first floated it at a meeting of a couple of dozen biogerontologists hosted by the inestimable Dan Perry, who had for many years led the Alliance for Aging Research (the leading gerontology lobbying organization in Washington) and who was another of the Longevity Dividend quartet. The essence of Felipe’s proposal was that the artificial divide between age-related “diseases” and “aging itself” could be bridged, in terms of research funding, by promoting cross-institute requests for applications (RFAs) – effectively creating a division of preventative medicine within each of the institutes whose focus is one or another age-related disease (which, let’s be clear, means the largest institutes). It took a little while for the less imaginative members of the biogerontology community to see what Felipe was getting at, but eventually they supported it with great enthusiasm. Er, but where is it now? I’m afraid to say that it remains little more than its name implies – an interest group, a talking shop. Virtually no RFAs of the imagined form have materialized. And in this case we can’t even

blame the name: “geroscience” is the mot du jour within biogerontology, largely because it
is totally new and thus devoid of baggage.
What was the problem? Unfortunately, it was the same one as before: no one in a decision-making capacity believed that there would be any actual result. Sierra’s boss’s boss (i.e. the head of the entire NIH), Francis Collins, has worked on aging for decades and was verbally very supportive of the GSIG when it began – but be has totally failed to fight for money for it, evidently reasoning that that would be a futile expenditure of political capital.
The pattern that I hope you have discerned in the above tales of woe is one of self-inflicted rejection. The basis for ignoring the protestations of gerontologists that hiking their funding would have a massive bang for the buck is that those gerontolgists will not, in fact, significantly succeed any time soon in their goals to postpone the health problems of old age as a result of receiving the requested funding. And the basis for that pessimistic conviction is, plain and simple, that gerontologists refuse to dispel it. The idea of making a timeframe prediction, however speculative, for how soon a given amount of progress can be made is so utterly anathema to those in this field that they recoil from doing so even though the result is so massively prejudicial to their ability to get their work done.
Is this just the way that science is? Is it truly better to underpromise and overdeliver, even to this plainly foot-shooting extent? Well, let’s ask the oncology community. Around the same time that the NIA’s creation was first being mooted, cancer biologists started to feel pretty optimistic (albeit wrongly) about the prospects of bringing cancer to its knees, and – critically – they started to say so publicly. We all know the result: the War on Cancer, implemented as a massive hike in funding for the National Cancer Institute. Decades later, progress has been far slower than experts were predicting back then. But so what? Progress has for sure been far faster than it would have been had funding remained stagnant – and moreover, funding has not at any point been cut as a result of failure to meet milestones on time.
The message is clear. It is time for biogerontologists to abandon the cowardice and short- sightedness that has for so long led them to deny their advocates the ammunition with which to secure them the public funding that they truly deserve. Providing that

ammunition – the explicit, albeit highly hedged, prediction of timeframes for given
amounts of progress – is not a crime against science. Rather, failing to provide it – and thus not only harming one’s own funding but also delaying the ultimate medical defeat of aging – is, and I know what I’m saying here, a crime against humanity",19,1559383806,longevity

&gt; Humans, as well as their closest ancestors, the higher African primates, exhibit female-biased survival and multiple sex differences in causes of death. However, the effects of sex on aging and longevity in an excellent model of human health, the companion dog, have not been well explored. Using two large independent databases on companion dog longevity and causes of death, we performed the most extensive analysis of sex differences in dog aging to date. Unlike the findings in humans, we observed only a small effect of sex on canine longevity. When broken down by neutering status, we discovered a small male advantage in survival among intact dogs but a clear female survival advantage among neutered dogs. Overall, the effect of neutering on life span was greater than the effect of sex. However, we found few sex differences in causes of death in either intact or neutered dogs. The results of this study suggest limited sex effects on either longevity or causes of death in the companion dog. Our analysis suggests that the majority of apparent sex differences in the wider canine populations may be due to the effects of neutering.",1,1559346709,longevity

&gt; Evidence
supporting the use of metformin to increase lifespan
and health outcomes originates from lower order model
organisms (Cabreiro et al. 2013; De Haes et al. 2014;
Onken and Driscoll 2010), whereas rodent models have
been more mixed (Anisimov et al. 2008, 2011; Dhahbi
et al. 2005; Martin-Montalvo et al. 2013; Smith et al.
2010; Strong et al. 2016). Although the majority of
health outcomes improve in rodent models, lifespan
either increases (Anisimov et al. 2008, 2011; Dhahbi
et al. 2005; Martin-Montalvo et al. 2013) or remains
unchanged with metformin treatment (Smith et al. 2010;
Strong et al. 2016).  

&gt; One study not supporting lifespan
extension is notable because it was part of the NIA
Interventions Testing Program (ITP) using heterogeneous mouse models that are designed to mimic the
genetic diversity of humans (Strong et al. 2016). In
humans, even the effectiveness of metformin for T2D
is variable. When genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have attempted to predict genetic determinants
of metformin treatment efficacy for T2D, only 20–34%
(depending on physiological outcome) of variability
was accounted for (Zhou et al. 2014). Therefore, there
are several important questions related to treatment efficacy of metformin for healthspan that remain to be
definitively answered.

&gt; **Background**  

&gt; Human life expectancy continues to rise in most populations. This rise not only leads to longer lives but also is accompanied by improved health at a given age, that is, recent cohorts show a reduction of biological age for a given chronological age. Despite or even because of the diversity of biomarkers of aging, an accurate quantification of a general shift in biological age across time has been challenging.

&gt; **Methods**  

&gt; Here, we compared age perception of facial images taken in 2001 over a decade and related these changes in age perception to changes in life expectancy.

&gt; **Results**  

&gt; We show that age perception changes substantially across time and parallels the progress in life expectancy. In 2012, people aged more than 70 years needed to look 2.3 years younger to be rated the same age as in 2002.

&gt; **Conclusions**

&gt; Our results suggest that age perception reflects the past life events better than predicts future length of life, that is, it is written in your face how much you have aged so far. We draw this conclusion as age perception among elderly individuals paralleled changes in life expectancy at birth but not changes in remaining life expectancies.

,shrillthrill,"So you are right that biological aging is not the same as chronological aging, the two can vary between individuals.  It might help if you look at a definition of aging:

From the [fightaging.org FAQ](https://www.fightaging.org/faq/#what-is-aging)

&gt; The simplest and most widely agreed upon definition of aging is also the least helpful: aging is a rise in the risk of death due to intrinsic causes, meaning the failure of one or more organs or systems vital to life. A person is more aged if his or her risk of death has grown over time.

&gt; For a better explanation than this we have to ask why and how aging happens. Broadly speaking there are two schools of thought on this matter. The first, dominant school argues that aging is caused by damage, forms of wear and tear to cells and tissues, and that damage leads to characteristic changes and failures in our biology. The second, lesser school argues that aging is an evolved program of characteristic changes and failures in our biology that in turn cause damage and eventual death.

&gt; It is a mark of how complex aging is under the hood that the research community can accurately measure all sorts of damage, changes, and failures that accompany aging, but still have room to argue over whether damage causes change or change causes damage.

&gt; When a person looks older or younger, is it a reliable indicator on the potential longevity of this person?

Photo-aging has been studied, which is to do with the amount of sun damage which is a type of accelerated damage that can tie in with aging.  Outside of this - appearance as a marker of health hasn't been particularly studied.  

Instead what researchers are looking at are biomarkers of aging based on biological aspects like telomeres or the epigenome.

Many authors note that telomere length may vary across in different organs and this needs further research.   For example:

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

[Analysis of the Association Between TERC and TERT Genetic Variation and Leukocyte Telomere Length and Human Lifespan—A Follow-Up Study (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/2/82/htm)

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

[Salk scientists find that for stem cells to be healthy, telomere length has to be just right (2016)](http://www.salk.edu/news-release/goldilocks-effect-aging-research/)

['This test is garbage': Experts in telomere biology and former employees allege that a Silicon Valley startup gives bogus 'cellular ages' based on a flawed blood test](https://www.thisisinsider.com/silicon-valley-telomere-blood-test-2018-9):

&gt; Elizabeth Blackburn, a biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, who won the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, in 2009, cofounded Telomere Diagnostics in 2010. The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

&gt; Elissa Epel, another UCSF researcher who cofounded the company with Blackburn, left at the same time for the same reasons.

&gt; Both researchers told Business Insider that they questioned the efficacy of Telomere Diagnostics' test. And a former Telomere Diagnostics employee said she witnessed practices that raised doubts about the company's cleanliness, commitment to scientific accuracy, and handling of private health information.

&gt;  the links between telomere length, health, and aging are not yet clear cut.

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been tied to higher rates of disease, faster tumor growth, and overall age-related degeneration. But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal. That means that we still do not fully understand telomeres or their role in aging and disease. So trying to lengthen or shorten your telomeres as a health intervention is arguably premature and, at worst, harmful, some experts say.

For epigenetic age / DNA methylation as a biomarker:

There are different methods of using DNA methylation to measure aging.   Horvath's clock, for example: 

[DNA methylation-based biomarkers and the epigenetic clock theory of ageing (2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324447658_DNA_methylation-based_biomarkers_and_the_epigenetic_clock_theory_of_ageing):

&gt; Horvath’s clock is the first multi-tissue age estimator that can accurately measure age using DNA from multiple sources of cells, tissues and organs (with the exception of sperm) across the entire lifespan. The high accuracy of this epigenetic clock has been validated in hundreds of independent data sets and has yet to fail.  

&gt; Since its inception, the multi-tissue age estimator has been used in a wide range of studies, including the determination of ageing rates of different parts of the body[8], which revealed that most tissues and organs from the same body exhibit broadly similar ages. This synchronicity of DNAm age across all tissues is perhaps the most intriguing feature of the epigenetic clock, as best highlighted by brain and blood cells. These cell types represent opposite spectral ends of cellular proliferation frequency and regeneration and yet yield similar epigenetic age estimates.

[Taming expectations of metformin as a treatment to extend
healthspan (2019)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s11357-019-00057-3)

&gt; Evidence
supporting the use of metformin to increase lifespan
and health outcomes originates from lower order model
organisms (Cabreiro et al. 2013; De Haes et al. 2014;
Onken and Driscoll 2010), whereas rodent models have
been more mixed (Anisimov et al. 2008, 2011; Dhahbi
et al. 2005; Martin-Montalvo et al. 2013; Smith et al.
2010; Strong et al. 2016). Although the majority of
health outcomes improve in rodent models, lifespan
either increases (Anisimov et al. 2008, 2011; Dhahbi
et al. 2005; Martin-Montalvo et al. 2013) or remains
unchanged with metformin treatment (Smith et al. 2010;
Strong et al. 2016).  

&gt; One study not supporting lifespan
extension is notable because it was part of the NIA
Interventions Testing Program (ITP) using heterogeneous mouse models that are designed to mimic the
genetic diversity of humans (Strong et al. 2016). In
humans, even the effectiveness of metformin for T2D
is variable. When genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have attempted to predict genetic determinants
of metformin treatment efficacy for T2D, only 20–34%
(depending on physiological outcome) of variability
was accounted for (Zhou et al. 2014). Therefore, there
are several important questions related to treatment efficacy of metformin for healthspan that remain to be
definitively answered.

So, on time restricted feeding (IF):

Recent research suggests that restricting feeding to a fixed window of 8-12 hours could have health benefits through circadian regulation.  This is known as Time Restricted Feeding (TRF) or Time Restricted Eating (TRE) in the research.

For example: one of the most well known researchers in this area is [Satchin Panda](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/) and team at Salk who have worked on TRF (time restricted feeding).   [Satchin often tweets about health implications of circadian regulation.](https://twitter.com/SatchinPanda)

Salk profile: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/

&gt; In the process of exploring how the liver’s daily cycles work, Panda found that mice which eat within a set amount of time (8-12 hours) resulted in slimmer, healthier mice than those who ate the same number of calories in a larger window of time, showing that when one eats may be as important as what one eats. If the benefits of this “time-restricted eating“ (TRE) hold true in humans, it could have profound impacts on treating overeating disorders, diabetes and obesity.

&gt; The circadian clock, he found, even mediates the immune system. Mice with a crucial circadian molecule missing had higher levels of inflammation in their bodies than other mice, suggesting that genes and molecules involved in the circadian clock could be drug targets for conditions linked to inflammation, such as infections or cancer.

&gt; Panda’s lab discovered that confining caloric consumption to an 8- to 12-hour period–as people did just a century ago– might stave off high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. He is exploring whether the benefits of time-restricted eating apply to humans as well as mice.

Rhonda Patrick did two interviews with Satchin on the topic:

* [Dr. Satchin Panda on Time-Restricted Feeding and Its Effects on Obesity, Muscle Mass &amp; Heart Health (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU) - ([podcastnotes](https://podcastnotes.org/2016/07/11/time-restricted-feeding-and-its-effects-on-obesity-muscle-mass-heart-health/))  
* [Dr. Satchin Panda on Practical Implementation of Time-Restricted Eating &amp; Shift Work Strategies (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iywhaz5z0qs&amp;vl=en)

Some papers on the topic:

* [Time restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake prevents metabolic diseases in mice fed a high fat diet (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/22608008/)  
* [Effects of eight weeks of time-restricted feeding (16/8) on basal metabolism, maximal strength, body composition, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk factors in resistance-trained males (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27737674/)

&gt; Thirty-four resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to time-restricted feeding (TRF) or normal diet group (ND). TRF subjects consumed 100 % of their energy needs in an 8-h period of time each day, with their caloric intake divided into three meals consumed at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m. The remaining 16 h per 24-h period made up the fasting period. Subjects in the ND group consumed 100 % of their energy needs divided into three meals consumed at 8 a.m., 1 p.m., and 8 p.m

&gt; Our results suggest that an intermittent fasting program in which all calories are consumed in an 8-h window each day, in conjunction with resistance training, could improve some health-related biomarkers, decrease fat mass, and maintain muscle mass in resistance-trained males.

* [Daily Fasting Improves Health and Survival in Male Mice Independent of Diet Composition and Calories (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197301)

&gt; Like CR animals, MF (single meal feeding) mice ate quickly, imposing periods of extended daily fasting on themselves that produced significant improvements in morbidity and mortality compared with AL (ad libitum).

On fasting for 3+ days (periodic fasting):

There is some initial research that suggests periodic fasting (with water), for 24-72 hours may confer positive health effects.  Research is on-going however, and ultimately how these things impact what is known about aging is somewhat limited.  Expect more results in the coming years.

[Exposure to Environmental Pollutants and Their Association with Biomarkers of Aging: A Multipollutant Approach (2019)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b07141)

&gt; Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and telomere length are putative aging biomarkers and are sensitive to environmental stressors, including pollutants. Our objective was to identify, from a set of environmental exposures, which exposure is associated with leukocyte mtDNA content and telomere length in adults. This study includes 175 adults from 50 to 65 years old from the cross-sectional Flemish Environment and Health study, of whom leukocyte telomere length and mtDNA content were determined using qPCR. The levels of exposure of seven metals, 11 organohalogens, and four perfluorinated compounds (PFHxS, PFNA, PFOA, PFOS) were measured. We performed sparse partial least-squares regression analyses followed by ordinary least-squares regression to assess the multipollutant associations. While accounting for possible confounders and coexposures, we identified that urinary cadmium (6.52%, 95% confidence interval, 1.06, 12.28), serum hexachlorobenzene (2.89%, 018, 5.68), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (11.38%, 5.97, 17.08) exposure were positively associated (p &lt; 0.05) with mtDNA content, while urinary copper (−9.88%, −14.82, −4.66) and serum perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (−4.75%, −8.79, −0.54) exposure were inversely associated with mtDNA content. Urinary antimony (2.69%, 0.45, 4.99) and mercury (1.91%, 0.42, 3.43) exposure were positively associated with leukocyte telomere length, while urinary copper (−3.52%, −6.60, −0.34) and serum perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (−3.64%, −6.60, −0.60) showed an inverse association.

Despite the existence of clickbait news articles titled ""secrets to a long life"" or similar that profile extremely long lived people (100+), there does not appear to be anything in terms of lifestyle that accounts for this.    The general thought is that people reach extreme longevity (90+ 100+) in spite of their habits, not because of them.   

Some of these articles on the death of individual centenarians, say they did things that don't appear to do anything for the [hallmarks of aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/):  smoked, drank alcohol, ate whatever they felt like, etc.    

It appears that people are long lived for having won a genetic lottery, after getting the benefits everyone get from antibiotics, hygiene, vaccination etc.   Even then, they still have a foot in the grave just going by their decline in functional capacity due to aging.   They may have longevity, but they don't have the best health.

For everyone else, adding some habits does not seem like an impactful strategy for extreme longevity, only a few extra years.  Nir Barzilai (leading the TAME trial, for testing Metformin in healthy people as a means to slow aging) has spoken about this publicly, and has a research paper: [Lifestyle Factors of People with Exceptional Longevity (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6034120/)

&gt; Although most of the studies in individuals with exceptional longevity have focused on genetic factors, the lifestyle of this population has received less attention. It is possible that those with exceptional longevity may practice a healthy lifestyle, or “longevity”-associated genes may protected them against the detrimental effects of an unhealthy lifestyle. To evaluate the lifestyle factors, including obesity, smoking, and physical activity, of individuals with exceptional longevity, a study was conducted in a well-defined cohort of Ashkenazi Jews with exceptional longevity


&gt; As previously noted, it has been suggested that, in the general population, lifestyle factors play a larger role in human lifespan than do genetic factors. Studies in the Seventh Day Adventist population, who typically follow a healthier lifestyle, suggest that such choices could add up to 8 additional years of life expectancy, although the role of genetics in the human lifespan may be more relevant in extreme longevity than in the general population.     

&gt; Although people with exceptional longevity may interact differently with the environment, they also seem to possess as many risk alleles associated with high disease risk as the general population. This was also observed in the current study population, and a “buffering” mechanism by which longevity alleles protect against diseases alleles has been suggested.  Thus, although for most people, interaction with the environment is important, and a healthier lifestyle may enhance lifespan, the presence of longevity genes in people with exceptional longevity counter the presence of disease-associated genes.

In conclusion,  there is no one weird trick for extreme longevity.     Solving problems that can be solved by diet (/r/nutrition and /r/ScientificNutrition), supplementation (/r/supplements), sleep, exercise (/r/fitness and /r/bodyweightfitness), or fasting (/r/fasting) is still the mainstay [until the first rejuvenation therapies arrive](https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/) that treat the damage and changes of aging that give rise to disease, and death.",1,1556654386,longevity

High muscular strength in adolescence, as assessed by knee extension and handgrip tests, was associated with a 20-35% lower risk of premature mortality due to any cause or cardiovascular disease, independently of body mass index or blood pressure; no association was observed with mortality due to cancer. Stronger adolescents had a 20-30% lower risk of death from suicide and were 15-65% less likely to have any psychiatric diagnosis (such as schizophrenia and mood disorders). Adolescents in the lowest tenth of muscular strength showed by far the highest risk of mortality for different causes

Muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with death from all causes and cancer in men, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential confounders.

For each of the three measures of physical capability (grip strength, chair rise speed, and standing balance time) those participants unable to perform the test and those in the lowest performing fifth were found to have higher mortality rates than those in the highest fifth.

Lower levels of physical capability at age 53 and inability to perform capability tests are associated with higher rates of mortality. Even at this relatively young age these measures identify groups of people who are less likely than others to achieve a long and healthy life.

Whether a loss of bone mass or an increase in DNA damage, the consequences of aging are often punctuated by transitions and discrete events, that reflect the evolution of tradeoffs in robustness versus fragility impacting strength, health, and cognition. In this talk, physicist [Jean Carlson](https://santafe.edu/people/profile/jean-carlson) illustrates the interplay between biological aging, adaptation, and the arrow of time through examples taken from her research and focus areas of a five-year Santa Fe Institute research theme, sponsored by the James S.

Her research focuses on fundamental principles underlying complexity in natural and technological systems. Carlson’s group is unique in the breadth of applications studied, which includes brains, bones, the immune system, the microbiome, communication and transportation systems, and natural disasters. What ties these projects together is development and application of a coherent underlying systems theory, emphasizing identification of mechanisms and cause and effect relationships, tradeoffs involving robustness and fragility, and constraints and limitations based on inherent uncertainties, all amidst a complex, dynamic environment.

""Despite controversies, can sirtuins be therapeutic targets in future medicine?
The answer is most likely affirmative for most researchers studying sirtuins and their functions. This is because, despite so many controversies, mammalian sirtuins have been clearly shown as a class of critical factors regulating many cellular processes, playing important functions in diverse tissues and systems. Sirtuin functions have been described in the central/peripheral nerve system, cardiovascular system, immune system, liver, bone, skeletal muscles, stem cells, and tissue regeneration. They have also been associated with most major diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, arthritis, and osteoporosis, all of which are age-related. For instance, in several types of cancers, knocking down SIRT1 sensitizes cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapies 73,81. However, the complexity of activities of sirtuins, and their widespread roles and activities, increases the difficulties in determining how best to modulate them therapeutically.

Sirtuins are a class of epigenetic regulators that modulate the activity of their targets by removing covalently attached acetyl groups. Small molecule regulators targeting sirtuins would provide a robust, rapid, and yet reversible cellular response. Indeed, two HDAC inhibitor drugs have already been approved to treat a certain type of lymphoma, and many more are under clinical trials for several types of cancers.

It should be noted that current HDAC inhibitor drugs all target the class I and II HDACs, not sirtuins, the class III HDAC. Nevertheless, thanks to the interest in screening for small molecular modulators for sirtuins, many sirtuin-specific inhibitors have been discovered and characterized, several of which have been tested to treat cancer in mouse models 81. Although resveratrol's function as a sirtuin activator is under debate, the compound rising with the fame of sirtuins did show many health benefits in clinical trials 66.

Current controversies around sirtuins will eventually lead us to a much better understanding for this class of enzymes, which should provide a clearer perspective for their use as targets in future medicine.""",1,1556033548,longevity

&gt; UT Health San Antonio and Texas Biomedical Research Institute have signed an animal care and joint research agreement to move dozens of important research animals from the Sam and Ann Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies to the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) on the Texas Biomed campus.

&gt; Texas Biomed uses its population of approximately 340 marmosets for various research projects, including experiments involving the emerging Zika virus and research into Parkinson’s disease. The marmosets from UT Health San Antonio’s Barshop Institute are used in aging research as part of the San Antonio Marmoset Aging Program. Combined, these programs will maintain more than 400 marmosets for research, making it the country’s largest marmoset colony dedicated to aging and infectious diseases research.

&gt; Marmosets are small New World monkeys that are excellent animal models in many areas of biomedical research.

&gt; “Marmosets are becoming an increasingly important biomedical model and are of particular interest in aging studies, due to their relatively short life span compared with other types of primates. The SNPRC has dedicated facilities and staff for the care and management of this unique species,” said Professor Suzette Tardif, Ph.D., associate director of the SNPRC.

Texas Biomed recently invested more than $2 million updating an entire building devoted to the care of this species with the capacity to hold up to 550 marmosets.

&gt; “To understand aging and how interventions such as exercise, diet and pharmacological agents might improve health across the life span, it is helpful to conduct comparative biology studies across species, including rodents and small animals. Marmosets have proven to be a great addition to the science of aging,” said Nicolas Musi, M.D., Barshop Institute director and professor of medicine in the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio.

&gt; The Marmoset Aging Program colony at Texas Biomed will be made up of 90 to 175 animals including a population of geriatric marmosets (animals between the ages of 10 and 20 years old) and a population of mid-life marmosets (between 6 to 9 years old) necessary for future aging studies.

&gt; Prior to their transport to Texas Biomed from the Barshop Institute, marmosets will undergo a medical evaluation to make sure they are healthy enough to move. Once the animals are housed at Texas Biomed, their care will be overseen by SNPRC staff and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee on the Texas Biomed campus.

...

&gt; “The National Institutes of Health plans to launch funding to expand marmoset research, and this agreement will provide an exceptional resource to our institutions and collaborators to understand the neurobiology of aging and treat conditions ranging from neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders to infectious diseases,” said Professor Andrea Giuffrida, Ph.D., vice president for research at UT Health San Antonio.",2,1556012416,longevity

&gt; DNA methylation (DNAm) algorithms of biological age provide a robust estimate of an individual’s chronological age, and can predict of their risk of age-related disease and mortality. This study reviewed the evidence that environmental, lifestyle and health factors are associated with the Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clocks. A systematic search identified 61 studies. Chronological age was correlated with DNAm age in blood (median 0.83, range 0.13-0.99). DNAm age was positively associated with frailty (three studies, n=3,093), and education was negatively associated with the Hannum estimate of DNAm age specifically (four studies, n=13,955). For most other exposures, findings were too inconsistent to draw conclusions. In a meta-analysis BMI was associated with increased DNAm age (Hannum β: 0.07, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.10; Horvath β:0.06, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.10), but there was no association with smoking (Hannum β:0.12, 95%CI -0.50 to 0.73; Horvath β:0.18, 95%CI -0.10 to 0.46). In conclusion, BMI were positively associated with biological ageing measured using DNAm, with some evidence that frailty also increased ageing. More research is needed to provide conclusive evidence regarding other exposures. This field of research has the potential to provide further insights into how to promote slower biological aging and ultimately prolong healthy life.",7,1555902103,longevity

In 1900 the [average life expectancy](http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html) was 46 for males and 49 for females.  This looks really low, but when you remember the [higher infant mortality rates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4838a2.htm) push down the average, so a person in their 40s was not considered old even thogh the average age might make it seem that way.

In 1900, heart disease and cancer were **diagnosed far less often** than now.  

&gt;In 1900, cancer and heart disease accounted for 18 percent of all deaths. Today, that figure's jumped to 63 percent. In addition to being responsible for a greater share of deaths overall, the absolute number of people being killed by these chronic conditions has also grown, from 201 people out of every 100,000 in 1900 to nearly 380 per 100,000 today.

This jump in cancer deaths may be because of better diagnostic tools, and because we had a treatment for other causes, so they lived long enough for cancer to happen or the heart to wear out.

 Vaccines and improvements to ""herd health"" are a big deal for reducing infant mortality.  Hygiene improvements and antibiotics also make a big difference.

**Smoking and high blood sugar** are the next 1/4 or risk factors.

The next 1/4 of risk includes **obesity, high cholesterol, alcohol use, and air pollution.**

Part of the Healthy Longevity Global Grand Challenge1 founded by the NAM, the Catalyst Awards are a global prize competition to launch later this year, designed to stimulate innovation to transform the field of healthy longevity. The program will culminate in one or more Healthy Longevity Grand Prizes for major breakthroughs in increasing human healthspan..

&gt;  ""At Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, we're working to change the trajectory of health for humanity. In addition to developing effective treatments, our 'World Without Disease' vision is to increasingly eliminate diseases through prevention, disease interception in its earliest forms and cures,"" said William N. Hait, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Johnson &amp; Johnson External Innovation, Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation LLC. ""Our goals are closely aligned with the NAM's Grand Challenge. A great idea can come from anywhere, and we are proud to partner with the NAM to catalyze new cross-disciplinary ideas and innovation that we believe will ultimately lead to novel solutions for aging in freedom from debilitating disease."".

&gt;  Dramatic breakthroughs in medicine, public health and social and economic development have resulted in unprecedented extensions of the human lifespan in many parts of the world over the past century. This demographic shift provides new opportunities as well as new challenges. Today, 8.5% of people worldwide (617 million) are aged 65 and over. By 2050, this percentage is projected to more than double, reaching 1.6 billion. The global population of people aged 80 and over is expected to more than triple between 2015 and 2050, growing from 126 million to 447 million.2.

&gt;  At the current pace, population aging is poised to impose a significant strain on economies, health systems and social structures worldwide. ""But it doesn't have to,"" said Victor Dzau, M.D., President, National Academy of Medicine. ""Just over the horizon, we can envision new medicines, technologies, preventive and social strategies to transform the way we age and ensure better health, function and productivity during a period of extended longevity."".

&gt;  ""Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation's commitment to a 'World Without Disease' aligns perfectly with the NAM's goal to extend the human healthspan globally and equitably, and I am grateful for their partnership on this important initiative. With its deep knowledge of the entire spectrum of human health, Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation is uniquely positioned to help advance the most promising innovations. I am confident that, by joining forces, we can accelerate breakthrough innovations that will transform the field and change the way we think about aging forever,"" Dzau added..

&gt;  The NAM Grand Challenge will roll out over three distinct phases and employ a tiered model of awards and prizes to stimulate new research and solutions around healthy longevity. Under the agreement, Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation will provide funding for the foundational Healthy Longevity Catalyst Awards in the U.S., to identify innovative, entrepreneurial proposals that have the greatest chance of being translatable into solutions to prevent, intercept and/or cure disease or deficits related to aging..

&gt;  In a separate, parallel effort, upon reaching a certain number of global NAM Catalyst Award winners, Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation will launch a series of QuickFire Challenge (QFC) idea crowd-sourcing competitions open exclusively to Catalyst Award winners, to support the further development of their ideas, help them compete for the ultimate NAM Healthy Longevity Grand Prize and bring their innovations to market. QFC winners typically receive funding and/or benefit from world-class lab facilities, business services, educational and mentorship support at one of 13 Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation – JLABS facilities around the world..

&gt;  ""At Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, we believe good health is the foundation of vibrant lives, thriving communities and forward progress. That's why for over 130 years we have been aiming to keep people well at every age and every stage of life,"" said Hait. ""We envision a world in which widespread disease is a historical artifact and people enjoy longer, healthier lives, promoted by technological and medical advances. To achieve this, we need to shift the paradigm from today's widespread focus on 'disease care' – where we wait for people to get sick, to only then do something about it – towards true health care, by keeping people well in the first place, eliminating disease and restoring people to full health.""",2,1555415458,longevity

&gt;  To further investigate the impact of senescent cells on ageing-related pigmentation, we performed an intervention that targeted senescent cells. Microneedle fractional radiofrequency (RF) is a cosmetic therapy that induces skin rejuvenation via electromagnetic thermal injury [28, 29]. The microneedle RF device was chosen to manipulate only dermal cells, in which the microneedles generate thermal coagulation columns in the dermis, not in the epidermis [30]. It was previously demonstrated that fractional laser treatment decreases the occurrence of senescent fibroblasts in aged dermis [31].  

&gt; Ten volunteers with SL were treated with RF, and skin samples were collected from 4 participants who agreed to undergo a skin biopsy before and at 6 weeks after treatment (Figure 5A). Following RF treatment, the number of senescent fibroblasts was significantly reduced (Figure 5B). The elimination of these cells was thought to be caused by RF-induced cell death. On day 3, cleaved caspase 3- and TUNEL-positive cells were observed (Figure 5C and Figure S15). The elimination of senescent fibroblasts from SL was accompanied by skin lightening. The L* (lightness) value measured by a chromameter were higher than those obtained at baseline, and histological evaluations consistently revealed a marked decrease in the epidermal pigmentation compared to baseline levels (Figure 5D). RF treatment increased the synthesis of collagen and restored SDF1 expression to levels comparable to those observed in perilesional normal skin (Figure 5E and Figure S16-17).  

&gt; These findings indicate that senescent fibroblasts play a crucial role in ageing-related pigmentation. They provide further support for the therapeutic potential of eliminating senescent cells and restoring SDF1 to correct uneven pigmentation.

,shrillthrill,"Abstract:

&gt; Research on aging requires the ability to measure aging, and therein lies a challenge: it is impossible to measure every molecular, cellular, and physiological change that develops over time, but it is difficult to prioritize phenotypes for measurement because it is unclear which biological changes should be considered aspects of aging and, further, which species and environments exhibit “real aging.” Here, I propose a strategy to address this challenge: rather than classify phenotypes as “real aging” or not, conceptualize aging as the set of all age-dependent phenotypes and appreciate that this set and its underlying mechanisms may vary by population. Use automated phenotyping technologies to measure as many age-dependent phenotypes as possible within individuals over time, prioritizing organism-level (i.e., physiological) phenotypes in order to enrich for health relevance. Use those high-dimensional phenotypic data to construct dynamic networks that allow aging to be studied with unprecedented sophistication and rigor.

Intro:

&gt; “Aging” is a convenient label for a diverse set of biological changes that develop in a high proportion of individuals within a population over an average lifespan. The concept that aging is worth studying is essentially a hypothesis that these conditions share causal mechanisms and that working to identify and combat those shared mechanisms is a viable strategy to improve the quality and duration of life. However, research in this area is undermined by preconceived notions that aging is a universal, intrinsic process that is distinct from disease and transcends species and environments. This leads to an excess of effort spent attempting to define and measure “true aging.” There is no such thing. Instead, I propose de-emphasizing the classification of phenotypes as aging (or not) and, instead, measuring the multi-dimensional set of all possible age-dependent phenotypes, which can change between populations and environments.

&gt; Epidemiological data suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) stave off dementia, but multiple clinical trials have failed to bear that out. Now, the most recent and, the authors say, final effort has come up short. In the INTREPAD trial, led by John Breitner, McGill University in Montreal, asymptomatic people in their 60s at high risk of Alzheimer’s disease took daily naproxen for two years. As published online April 5 in Neurology, the regimen did not affect their cognition or imaging and CSF markers, and may have even made the primary outcome, a composite of all these measures, a bit worse. What’s more, and as predicted, the drugs caused significant side effects, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular problems.

&gt; Taken together with previous trials, INTREPAD should mark the end of the road for NSAIDs and AD prevention, the authors and several commentators agreed. “This is a good and important study that allows us to conclude that NSAIDs are just not going to be effective in this condition,” said Lon Schneider, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles. Eric Larson of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle expressed similar sentiments. “The drugs caused enough harm to be detectable in a trial, and they produced no benefit. School is out for NSAIDs for prevention,” Larson said.

&gt; Breitner sees it the same way. “I do not think there should be any more clinical trials of NSAIDs for prevention or treatment of AD,” he said. “There was a lot of hope, based on epidemiological data, that these drugs would prove to be beneficial, but we’ve learned over the last 10 to 15 years that when you test NSAIDs in trials, they are not beneficial and invariably, you make people sick,” he added..

&gt;  A two-decade stream of epidemiological studies linked the use of NSAIDs for chronic inflammatory conditions to a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease. The data fit a biological theory that inflammation stokes AD pathogenesis, and led to a series of trials of various NSAIDs for prevention. In the largest of those, ADAPT, people at high risk of AD due to a family history of the disease took daily doses of naproxen or celecoxib, and were monitored for age-related cognitive decline or onset of AD.  The trial was supposed to run for five to seven years, but was stopped early due to concerns about cardiovascular safety. The truncated trial revealed no evidence for efficacy, but the data held out the possibility that naproxen could stem cognitive decline in people treated in the earliest presymptomatic stages (Breitner et al., 2011). .

&gt;  INTREPAD, described by co-first authors Pierre-Francois Meyer and Jennifer Tremblay-Mercier, was designed specifically to test naproxen in this earliest-stage, at-risk, but cognitively normal group. To join the study, people had to have a strong family history of AD, including a parent or multiple siblings, or both, with the disease. The researchers rigorously screened participants, mostly in their 60s, for what Breitner termed “cognitive fragility,” or any signs of decline or incipient dementia. The participants took 220 mg naproxen twice daily, or placebo..

&gt;  For the trial, the investigators developed a new composite primary endpoint to track disease progression in asymptomatic volunteers. The Alzheimer Progression Score (APS) comprised the RBANS battery to measure cognitive decline, along with assessments of olfactory function, brain structure, cerebral blood flow, and, in half the volunteers, cerebrospinal fluid total tau and Aβ42. An increase in the APS signaled disease progression..

&gt;  Over the two-year treatment period, the APS composite worsened in the group as a whole, but there was no difference in the rate of change between treatment and placebo groups. On the contrary, there was a trend for naproxen to promote progression, as reported for people with memory impairment in earlier studies. None of the individual endpoints benefitted from treatment..

&gt;  Naproxen did cause more side effects, and more severe adverse events. Gastrointestinal complaints, constipation, shortness of breath, high blood pressure, and petechiae—small lesions caused by bleeding under the skin—were the most common. Serious vascular or cardiac events were also more common in the naproxen group..

&gt;  The trial had limitations. The CSF measures were expected to enhance its power to detect changes, but did not. As a result, the trial was underpowered. In addition, the baseline composite scores of the treatment and placebo groups differed. In an accompanying editorial, Linda Hershey at the University of Oklahoma Health Center in Oklahoma City and Richard Lipton, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, raised the prospect that another trial with a different dose of naproxen, another NSAID, or a different high-risk group might produce a different result. Breitner and colleagues disagree. They believe that due to the lack of apparent benefit, and the demonstrated harm, further trials with NSAIDs would raise ethical concerns..

&gt;  This is not the first time AD epidemiological data has not panned out in subsequent clinical trials. Other examples include estrogen replacement, rosiglitazone, statins, and others. It is unclear why the trial results are at odds with the epidemiological data. In the case of NSAIDs, perhaps their use is merely an indicator for an underlying immune response that spares people from AD. “I don’t think we can exclude that possibility, based on everything we’ve done up to this point,” Breitner said..

&gt;  Gregory Cole, University of California, Los Angeles, pointed out that the dosing regimen could be critical: Using NSAIDS intermittently, as many people do, versus the constant exposure in the trial, could modulate the immune system differently (see comment below). .

&gt;  Piet Eikelenboom, Vrije University in Amsterdam, has pioneered research into inflammatory processes in aging and Alzheimer’s. He argues that the original rationale for NSAID treatment may no longer hold, and noted a meta-analysis suggesting that the reported NSAID benefits may have resulted from recall, prescription, and publication bias (de Craen et al., 2005).

Gagnon, A., 2015. [Natural fertility and longevity](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)00235-6/fulltext#sec3). *Fertility and Sterility*, *103*(5), pp.1109-1116. 

Number of children ever born:

&gt;In general, studies of historical populations have been inconsistent at best, showing positive, negative, or no relationships between total parity and post-reproductive survival, whereas studies of contemporary populations have reported a U-shaped effect, where nulliparous and women with more than four to five children had the highest mortality... Since the publication of those systematic reviews, high parity has been shown to correlate positively with age at death in at least five studies, negatively in at least two studies, and inconclusively in another.

It's worth noting for this discussion, that marriage is associated with longer life, for men moreso than for women, though this is only true for those who report good health at baseline (marriage doesn't help those in poor health). I  suspect this mostly reflects the regular association of conviviality with lifespan, and the poorer likelihood that men find and maintain long-term friendships outside of marriage. For many people, having children is good way to remain  social/convivial into advanced age.

Personally, I've followed the climate and resource crises for decades, expect the 21\^st and 22\^nd centuries to present a population bottleneck through which few descendants will pass, and for me having children would be unethical.

&amp;#x200B;

I think you're making a number of unhelpful assumptions about what fisetin fundamentally \*is\*, and what it should conceivably be capable of doing for the plants it's found in.

&amp;#x200B;

You refer to fisetin as a coloring agent, and you seem to implicitly assume that that is its fundamental purpose - that it only exists to make strawberries red, for example. One, we don't know if that is its primary function within strawberries, or an incidental side effect. Two, it doesn't matter what its function in strawberries is; the only thing that matters to us here is if it also happens to be capable of interesting biomolecular interactions in humans. It's not fundamentally a 'coloring agent', it's fundamentally a \*molecule\*, which has a particular shape and biochemical interactivity, which could (by pure coincidence, or by being evolutionarily designed to perform analogous bio-functions in strawberries as in humans; doesn't matter which in the end) have meaningful uses for our purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

You also assume that if it were in any way protective of health in humans, then a logical corollary would probably be that it should also protect strawberries from things like mold and disease. This is not a reasonable expectation. Suppose I were to tell you that aspirin is found in willow trees, and that even though taking aspirin helps humans manage pain, willow trees still die from various tree diseases - is this surprising? Should any molecule that's found to have some specific health benefit be expected to be effective against every possible form of disease? Of course not.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do some people think fisetin is worth studying in humans when strawberries contain it and are still susceptible to mold? Because a bunch of compelling studies in mice (which, as mammals, are much more like humans than strawberries are) seem to suggest that it could potentially perform a very valuable function in  humans. We will see if human studies can replicate any of the exciting results from mouse studies, but if they do there will be no surprise due just because strawberries aren't resistant to every form of disease.",1,1555013133,longevity
,shrillthrill,"To save a click (contains update on mouse lemur CR study):

&gt; Caloric restriction (CR) is a nutritional intervention consisting in eating less without malnutrition. Its beneficial effects on healthspan and lifespan are very clear in short-lived species (both invertebrates and vertebrates) while they have long been debated in primates. In 2006 was initiated a long-term project, called the “Restrikal study”, which was aimed at assessing the effects of chronic-moderate CR in a nonhuman primate species1. Our 2018 publication of the main results of the Restrikal study2 brought new arguments in this debate.

&gt; In this study, we subjected a cohort of young adult gray mouse lemurs to a 30% CR diet, compared to a control group, until their natural death. The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small malagasy primate with numerous similarities to humans, in particular during aging, for which it represents a promising and emerging model3,4. Compared to control animals showing a median survival time of 6.4 years, CR extended survival by 50%, reduced aging-associated diseases and preserved loss of brain white matter in several brain regions. However, CR accelerated loss of gray matter throughout much of the cerebrum. Up to five years of treatment, CR did not change the cognitive status in spatial and working memory tests or neuromuscular performances. Thus, chronic-moderate CR does extend lifespan and enhance health of a primate, but at the expense of brain gray matter integrity.

&gt; Two studies on the impact of CR on health and lifespan had been previously initiated in rhesus monkeys5,6. Their investigators initially reported contradictory results on survival7, but finally concluded to a positive impact of CR on health and survival though their mortality curves were still incomplete8. In this context, our study brought the most advanced survival dataset for a primate under CR (all control animals were dead at the time of the publication) with very strong effect of calorie restriction on all-cause mortality. Since our publication in Communications Biology in April 2018, all calorie-restricted mouse lemurs are now dead, demonstrating an increase in maximum lifespan of more than 22% (13.8 years in the restricted group vs. 11.3 years in the control group, Fig. 1).

,shrillthrill,"&gt; Ageing is an inevitable process for all living organisms, characterised by their progressive functional decline at the molecular, cellular, and organismal level. This makes ageing a key determinant for human lifespan and a major risk factor for many so-called age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Preventing ageing by pharmaceutical means is therefore an attractive strategy to help people live healthier and longer lives..

&gt;  Finding substances that prevent ageing is challenging. Experiments on mammals are costly and time consuming. Using cultured human cells, it is possible to test a larger number of substances, but ageing is a complex process that is difficult to measure at the cellular level. A solution to this problem is now presented by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, in a study published in the journal Cell Reports..

&gt;  ""With our method, cell culture systems can be used to see how different substances affect the biological age of the cells,"" says Christian Riedel, researcher at the Department of Biosciences and Nutrition who led the study..

&gt;  The researchers' method is based on a new way interpreting cellular information, in particular the so-called transcriptome. The transcriptome represents the information about all the RNA present in a particular cell or tissue at a given time. Recently, it has been shown that the transcriptome of a human cell can be used to predict the age of the person from whom the cell came..

&gt;  The researchers used a large amount of transcriptome data from published sources to develop their method. With machine learning methods, so-called classifiers were built that can distinguish transcriptomes coming from ""young"" versus ""old"" donors..

&gt;  The classifiers were used to analyse changes in the transcriptome of human cells, induced by over 1,300 different substances (data is openly available from the Connectivity Map, Broad Institute, USA). In this way, the researchers wanted to identify substances that could shift human transcriptomes to a ""younger"" age. The method identified several candidate substances, both those already known to extend the lifespan in different organisms and new candidate substances..

&gt;  The most interesting substances were further investigated in the worm C. elegans, which is a common model organism for studying ageing. Two substances that could prolong the life of the worms belong to a substance class not previously shown to have this ability; inhibitors that block a protein called heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). These substances are Monorden and Tanespimycin. Beyond extending lifespan Mondoren also improved the health of these model animals..

&gt;  ""We have developed an innovative method for finding substances that can prevent aging and we identify Hsp90 inhibitors as new and promising candidate substances,"" says Christian Riedel. ""Hsp90 inhibitors are already being tested for other treatment purposes, and now further studies are needed to investigate their effect on human ageing."".

&gt;  The researchers show that the substances work by activating a protein called heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf-1). This is known to lead to the expression of so-called chaperon proteins that improve the animals' ability to keep their proteins correctly folded and thus in a functional state throughout their lifetime.

Abstract:

&gt; Aging strongly influences human morbidity and mortality. Thus, aging-preventive compounds could greatly improve our health and lifespan. Here we screened for such compounds, known as geroprotectors, employing the power of transcriptomics to predict biological age. Using age-stratified human tissue transcriptomes and machine learning, we generated age classifiers and applied these to transcriptomic changes induced by 1,309 different compounds in human cells, ranking these compounds by their ability to induce a “youthful” transcriptional state. Testing the top candidates in C. elegans, we identified two Hsp90 inhibitors, monorden and tanespimycin, which extended the animals’ lifespan and improved their health. Hsp90 inhibition induces expression of heat shock proteins known to improve protein homeostasis. Consistently, monorden treatment improved the survival of C. elegans under proteotoxic stress, and its benefits depended on the cytosolic unfolded protein response-inducing transcription factor HSF-1. Taken together, our method represents an innovative geroprotector screening approach and was able to identify a class that acts by improving protein homeostasis.",8,1554977408,longevity

Chan School of Public Health in 2011, where he currently serves as an Associate Professor in the Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases. William Mair received a first-class honors degree (B.Sc.) in Genetics from University College London, UK, in 2000. After working in journalism for a year, Dr. Mair returned to UCL to continue his scientific career under the supervision of Professor Dame Linda Partridge, receiving a Ph.D. in Biology in 2005. He then moved to San Diego to for his postdoctoral training with Dr. Andrew Dillin at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, before joining Harvard as an Assistant Professor in November 2011. The Mair lab’s research studies the basic biology of the aging process, driven by the central questions: Why are we more likely to get chronic diseases when we are old than when we are young? What goes wrong in cells and tissues to increase overall disease risk, is this decline inevitable, or can we reverse it to bring healthy years to the elderly?  

&gt; Specifically, the Mair Lab studies the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which animals modulate the rate at which they age and succumb to disease in response to changes in nutrition and the environment. By elucidating the genetic and molecular pathways that dictate the link between metabolism and aging, Dr. Mair aims to recapitulate the positive effects of dietary restriction on lifespan and health without the need for changes in dietary intake and its associated detrimental side effects, with the goal of developing new therapeutics for age-related diseases. Dr. Mair has received the New Scholar in Aging Award from the Ellison Medical Foundation, the Glenn Foundation Award for Research in Biological Mechanisms of Aging, and the American Federation for Aging Research Breakthrough in Gerontology Award. His lab is supported by the National Institutes of Health.

&gt; Roberta Diaz Brinton, an internationally recognized expert on Alzheimer’s disease and inaugural director of the Center for Innovation in Brain Science at the University of Arizona Health Sciences, has received a five-year, $1.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health Institute on Aging..

&gt;  With the funding, Brinton will develop a unique training program to cultivate a diverse pool of highly trained scientists from diverse fields who can effectively address the nation’s Alzheimer’s research needs..

&gt;  “Curing Alzheimer’s disease requires a multidisciplinary approach. We have the team and the strategy to build an innovative, expertise-diverse team to address this challenge,” Brinton said. “Through this NIA training grant, we have the opportunity to innovate our national scientific and clinical workforce to develop therapeutics to address the epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease.”.

&gt;  To achieve that goal, Dr. Brinton and colleagues have designed an innovative, collaborative training program that is patient-inspired and data driven: the University of Arizona Translational Research on Alzheimer’s Disease and AD Related Dementias program, or AZ-TRADD..

&gt;  “Our goal,” Brinton noted, “is to train the next generation of Alzheimer’s researchers in 21st century team science that spans translational, clinical and big data science. Our stellar team of University of Arizona translational faculty and community partners is uniquely qualified to support and foster AZ-TRADD. Importantly, the UA’s diverse, passionate and exceptional graduate and medical students are poised to be at the vanguard of innovators in developing cures for Alzheimer’s.”.

&gt;  “The innovative translational research at the University of Arizona into extending the cognitive health span to match our life spans is a strategic priority for the university and we are all thrilled by the incredible work that Dr. Brinton and her team are doing to understand Alzheimer’ disease,” said UA President Robert C. Robbins. “I am confident that Dr. Brinton's team of world-class translational Alzheimer’s researchers will develop the next generation of leaders in the field and, in turn, develop treatments and someday possible cures for this devastating disease that affects so many people across the globe.”.

&gt;  Based at the UAHS Center for Innovation in Brain Science and the UAHS Clinical Translational Sciences Program, led by Dr. Jorge Gomez, the AZ–TRADD training program will recruit predoctoral pharmacy and medical students from across multiple disciplines to serve as fellows..

&gt;  “Our program is designed to develop innovative translational researchers who embrace the complexity of Alzheimer’s by providing them the best mentors and tools to cure this devastating disease,” Brinton said..

&gt;  To achieve the program’s goal, Brinton has an “all brains on deck” approach. She is joined in this endeavor by UAHS Center for Innovation for Brain Science colleagues: Kathy Rodgers; Dr. Lalitha Madhavan; Fei Yin; May Khanna; Kevin Gaffney; Rui Chang; Alex Thome; and 16 core faculty mentors across the UA, including UA McKnight Brain Institute members Carol Barnes, director and Regents’ Professor, Lee Ryan and Meredith Hay; Dr. Anita Koshy; and UA Data Science Institute Director Nirav Merchant..

&gt;  Through a diverse team of UA faculty “accelerators,” AZ-TRADD fellows will receive in-depth training from UA experts in topics ranging from immunology to machine learning and therapeutic development. In addition, the program's community partners – the Alzheimer’s Association Desert Southwest Chapter and the Critical Path Institute – will be key contributors..

&gt;  In its inaugural year, the AZ-TRADD program will recruit six fellows..

&gt;  The UA is one of three institutions in the United States and the first in the West to receive an NIA grant to develop training programs to advance translational research training for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias..

&gt; By blocking a protein’s activity with antibodies, Stanford University School of Medicine investigators were able to improve cognitive behavior in aging mice.

&gt;  A paper describing the finding was published online April 3 in Nature. Tony Wyss-Coray, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences, is the senior author. The lead author is MD-PhD student John Pluvinage.

&gt;  Wyss-Coray has been working for several years on the question of what causes the brain to lose its acuity with advancing age. One focus of his research has been a class of brain cells called microglia, which serve both as the brain’s immune cells and its garbage crew. Among the many different things microglia do to keep the brain healthy is scarfing up bits of cellular debris and protein deposits that build up in the course of normal metabolic activity.

&gt;  On average, the garbage-collecting performance of microglia diminishes in aging brains. Why this happens, and the extent to which the faulty garbage service is actually responsible for age-related cognitive losses, are unclear. But it’s a decent bet that one way or another, microglial malperformance plays a role in neurodegeneration, said Wyss-Coray, the D. H. Chen Professor II and a senior research career scientist at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System.

&gt;  “Many of the genes whose high-risk variants have recently been linked to Alzheimer’s disease are known to be active in the brain only in microglia,” he said. “Microglial genes’ activation patterns are abnormal in Alzheimer’s patients, and in other neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

&gt;  “We think we may have discovered a way to get those cells back on track and make them work the way they used to when we were young..

&gt;  The ingest-then-digest procedure employed by microglia and other immune-cell types in the body is called phagocytosis. The study used laboratory techniques to identify mouse genes whose activity either impairs or enhances microglial phagocytosis and whose activity levels either increase or decrease substantially with age..

&gt;  Blocking genes’ functionality
The investigators picked about 3,000 genes encoding proteins that they judged could be targeted by drugs or that had already been the focus of drug development. One at a time, they blocked each gene’s ability to encode a protein. The goal was to learn how each blockade affected the ability of cultured mouse microglia to ingest small particles of fluorescently labeled latex. (The brighter a microglial cell glowed, the better a refuse eater it was..

&gt;  “It was like examining the books of the garbage-hauling company,” Wyss-Coray said. “We wanted to know: ‘Is it the garbage truck’s faulty wheels? The rusty containers? An unanticipated garbage overflow? Lazy or poorly trained staff? Or is the street in bad shape?’.

&gt;  In a parallel experiment, the investigators determined which of those approximately 3,000 genes are more or less active in microglia from the hippocampi of young mice versus old mice. (The hippocampus is a brain structure, one on each side of the brain, that’s essential to learning and memory..

&gt;  Surprisingly, when the scientists compared the results of both experiments, they found just one gene that affected microglial phagocytosis and whose activity in microglia substantially changed with advancing age. Older microglia produced far more copies of this gene — a proxy for upregulated production of the protein for which the gene is a blueprint — than younger ones did, and knocking out its function greatly improved microglial phagocytosis.

&gt;  “Now we had a tentative suspect, a gene that had never before been implicated in microglial garbage removal,” Wyss-Coray said. So they zeroed in on this gene, called CD22, which is found in both mice and humans..

&gt;  In a follow-on experiment, the CD22 protein turned up three times as often on the surface of older mice’s microglia as on those of younger mice’s microglia, confirming the gene-activity finding. These proteins could be blocked by antibodies, molecules that bind to a specific protein and can be generated in the lab. Antibodies are bulky and don’t easily penetrate cells, but they’re excellent for targeting cell-surface proteins.

&gt;  Injecting antibodies
Wyss-Coray’s team injected antibodies to the CD22 protein into the hippocampus on one side of mice’s brains. They also injected similar antibodies that were incapable of binding to CD22 into the hippocampus on the opposite side.

&gt;  Along with the antibodies, the scientists administered fluorescence-labeled bits of myelin. This substance coats numerous nerve cells, for which it provides insulation. But myelin debris accumulates in aging brains and has been shown to overwhelm microglia’s ability to clear it away.

&gt;  Wyss-Coray and his associates found that, 48 hours later, the myelin bits they’d injected into the mice’s hippocampi were far less prevalent on the side where they had administered CD22-blocking antibodies rather than “dummy” antibodies..

&gt;  “Microglia are the only cells in mice’s brain that actually express the CD22 protein, so this difference is likely due to the CD22-blocking antibodies’ effect on microglia,” Pluvinage said..

&gt;  CD22 is a new target we think can be exploited for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
The investigators conducted analogous experiments, substituting a protein called beta-amyloid, whose buildup in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, and alpha-synuclein, another protein similarly associated with Parkinson’s disease. In both cases, microglia exposed to CD22-blocking antibodies outperformed their peers on the opposite side of the brain in ingesting the neurodegeneration-linked substances.

&gt;  Then, the researchers lengthened the period of exposure from 48 hours to a full month. They reconfigured their injection technique to provide continuous CD22-blocking antibody infusion on both sides of the brain over this period. Along with a host of findings consistent with their earlier ones, Wyss-Coray’s team observed that old mice receiving these infusions outperformed control mice of the same age on two different tests of learning and memory that are commonly used to assess mice’s cognitive ability.

&gt;  “The mice became smarter,” Wyss-Coray said. “Blocking CD22 on their microglia restored their cognitive function to the level of younger mice. CD22 is a new target we think can be exploited for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases..

&gt; The new study, published March 27 in Scientific Reports, contributes to a growing body of work exploring cell therapy approaches to barrier repair in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.

&gt; The progressive degeneration of nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) eventually leads to total paralysis and death from ALS. Each day, an average of 15 Americans are diagnosed with the disease, according to the ALS Association.

&gt; Damage to the barrier between the blood circulatory system and the central nervous system has been recognized as a key factor in the development of ALS. A breach in this protective wall opens the brain and spinal cord to immune/inflammatory cells and other potentially harmful substances circulating in peripheral blood. The cascade of biochemical events leading to ALS includes alterations of endothelial cells lining the inner surface of tiny blood vessels near damaged spinal cord motor neurons.

&gt; This latest study by lead author Svitlana Garbuzova-Davis, PhD, and colleagues at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine's Center of Excellence for Aging &amp; Brain Repair, builds upon a previous study showing that human bone marrow-derived stem cells improved motor functions and nervous system conditions in symptomatic ALS mice by advancing barrier repair. However, in that earlier USF study the beneficial effect was delayed until several weeks after cell transplant and some severely damaged capillaries were detected even after a high-dose treatment. So in this study, the researchers tested whether human EPCs - cells harvested from bone marrow but more genetically similar to vascular endothelial cells than undifferentiated stem cells - would provide even better BSCB restoration.

&gt; ALS mice were intravenously administered a dose of human bone-marrow derived EPCs. Four weeks after transplant, the results of the active cell treatment was compared against findings from two other groups of mice: ALS mice receiving a media (saline) treatment and untreated healthy mice.

&gt; The symptomatic ALS mice receiving EPC treatments demonstrated significantly improved motor function, increased motor neuron survival and slower disease progression than their symptomatic counterparts injected with media. The researchers suggest that these benefits leading to BSCB repair may have been promoted by widespread attachment of EPCs to capillaries in the spinal cord. To support this proposal, they point to evidence of substantially restored capillaries, less capillary leakage, and re-establishment of structural support cells (perivascular astrocytes) that play a role in helping form a protective barrier in the spinal cord and brain.

&gt; Further research is needed to clearly define the mechanisms of EPC barrier repair. But, the study authors conclude: ""From a translational viewpoint, the initiation of cell treatment at the symptomatic disease stage offered robust restoration of BSCB integrity and shows promise as a future clinical therapy for ALS.""

&gt; LEXINGTON, Ky. (April 2, 2019) -- Alzheimer's disease wreaks emotional havoc on patients, who are robbed of their memories, their dignity, and their lives. It's financially devastating as well: care for Alzheimer's patients is predicted to top $1 trillion by about the time children born today are having children of their own.

&gt;  To date, there have been very few successes in the pursuit of a treatment. But one drug that looks at AD from a different angle is now ready for its first round of testing in humans.

&gt;  The vast majority of AD treatments that are currently FDA-approved or in the pipeline target amyloid, which is responsible for the hallmark plaques that interfere with cognition. As the so-called ""Amyloid Theory"" has produced one drug failure after another, scientists have begun to explore other therapeutic avenues. Linda Van Eldik, Director of the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging at the University of Kentucky, has set her sights on an understudied, but (in her view) more promising target: brain inflammation.

&gt;  ""Inflammation is normally a 'good guy.' It clears infections and helps heal wounds, for example,"" said Van Eldik. ""But in Alzheimer's disease, the inflammation somehow gets out of whack. It gets too strong and sustains for too long -- it's now turned into a 'bad guy,' destroying the neurons that carry signals from one part of the brain to the next..

&gt;  Van Eldik began collaborating with Martin Watterson at Northwestern University to identify a drug that would block the ""bad"" inflammation in the brain without affecting the ""good"" inflammation that helps jumpstart repair.

&gt;  After years of research, Van Eldik is ready to test this drug -- enigmatically named MW-151 -- in humans. Both the National Institutes of Health and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation are sufficiently intrigued that they've bet a combined $5.5 million to underwrite her efforts.

&gt;  This is quite an accomplishment: current estimates say that for every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds that enter the drug discovery process, only five will go into a human clinical trial.

&gt;  Even if MW-151 beats the considerable odds that confront every potential new drug, it's years away from being available to the public. If the drug ultimately proves safe and effective, Van Eldik believes that MW-151 will function as a once-daily pill that staves off dementia, much like a baby aspirin prescribed to prevent heart attack or stroke.

&gt;  That could be a game-changer in the fight against AD. According to the Alzheimer's Association, delaying the onset of dementia by just five years would cut the incidence almost in half, which translates to enormous financial and emotional savings for patients and their families.

&gt;  Van Eldik does not consider MW-151 a silver bullet, however.

&gt;  ""This is a very complex disease "" she cautions. ""A single approach -- even our approach against inflammation -- may not be enough..

&gt;  ""I think this drug it will be most effective as part of a 'cocktail' of drugs that target multiple mechanisms of the disease. If that worked out, boy, that would be a slam dunk..

There are three clinical trials listed on the roadmap that deal with telomeres:  https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/


It's not clear whether simple measurements can be made from blood tests of leukocyte telomere length.  ['This test is garbage': Experts in telomere biology and former employees allege that a Silicon Valley startup gives bogus 'cellular ages' based on a flawed blood test](https://www.thisisinsider.com/silicon-valley-telomere-blood-test-2018-9)


Many authors note that telomere length may vary across in different organs, and this needs further research before you start trying to wildly lengthen your telomeres.


[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

[Analysis of the Association Between TERC and TERT Genetic Variation and Leukocyte Telomere Length and Human Lifespan—A Follow-Up Study (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/2/82/htm)

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

,gowithflow192,"Very difficult to say.

For starters, I have always struggled with advice of moderate to high intensity exercise several times a week (a 'fit' person) when only in recent decades has this become popular and in the Far East traditionally very few people go to the gym. I don' t hear of old Okinawans regularly pumping iron or running around town, for example.

There was a study done on a mountain-side village in Italy where people had good longevity. I assume they controlled for diet and I think they theorized that living in houses with multiple floors, each of a small footprint and therefore requiring regular use of the stairs contributed to their long life.

One thing I try to avoid but generally fail to do is sitting for long periods of time. I know there is evidence that says this is very, very bad for your health, and doing exercise in your spare time only mitigates this to a degree.

However, I do walk around 10,000 steps per day. Around 4,000 to work and back and the rest done during a lunchtime walk. Many gym addicts would say I am not fit at all but is this true? I really don't know. I know that I walk more than most people, not including gym users.

Again I am drawn back to these people who eat well and live long and never went to a gym, pumped iron or ran in their life, and live long. I'm not denying that these have benefits (especially heart health) but there are so many people who don't that I'm unconvinced of the longevity benefit.

Also, there are many athletes who have incredible heart health during their career but the exercise actually creates long term problems. For example, there are some endurance athletes I have heard require bypass or other heart surgery later in life.",1,1554228959,longevity

Cardio has to be the most important for long life, but low impact activities like swimming are preferable to high impact endurance training like running (on pavement especially). If your joints are trashed from years of intense activity, you won’t be able to train at all in your later years.

&gt; On March 26th 2019, The Wall Street Journal spotlighted research by AFAR experts Gary Churchill, PhD and Richard Miller, MD, PhD that explores how animals and humans age differently, based on their on-going research with the oldest living mice.

&gt; Dr. Miller is a 1985 [AFAR ](https://www.afar.org/) Research Grant recipient and recent AFAR Scientific Committee member.

&gt; Dr. Churchill is the Director of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the [Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org/), one of the six Nathan Shock Centers of the [NIA](https://www.nia.nih.gov/), for which AFAR serves as the [coordinating center](http://www.nathanshockcenters.org/).

&gt; The Wall Street Journal article --“[This Old Mouse: ‘Golden Girls’ Unlock the Mysteries of Aging” -- is available by subscription only here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-key-to-eternal-youthold-mice-11553612241), but a related Biospace story can be [read here](https://www.biospace.com/article/-golden-girls-mice-key-to-longevity-research/):



&gt; Even more fundamental, however, is a Wall Street Journal article with the clever headline, “This Old Mouse: ‘Golden Girls’ Unlock the Mysteries of Aging.”

&gt; The story profiles the research of Gary Churchill, a geneticist at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. Specifically, the 2016 death of two laboratory mice, Grace and Blanche, who were second cousins, but for a time were believed to be the oldest living mice in the world prior to their death. Affectionately known as the “Golden Girls,” Grace was four years and nine months old when she died, the rough equivalent of 150 human years.

&gt; No mice have been known to live five years. “We have 1,000 more Graces in the pipeline,” Churchill told the WSJ. “We’re gunning for five years.”

&gt; In fact, the Methuselah Foundation awards an annual Methuselah Mouse Prize (Mprize), for the oldest-ever mouse, and one for the most successful approach to rejuvenating the health of old mice. The Methuselah Foundation’s strategic goal is “Making 90 the New 50 by 2030.”

&gt; But Grace and Blanche and their enormous extended family are not ordinary mice. The Jackson Laboratory is a nonprofit specializing in research and mouse production. In attrition to its mammalian genetics headquarters in Bar Harbor, JAX, as it’s known, has a Genomic Medicine Institute in Farmington, Conn., and facilities in Sacramento, Calif. and Ellsworth, Maine.

&gt; JAX was founded in 1929 as a 501c3 nonprofit biomedical research institution with a National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center. It employs more than 2,100 people, and its goal is to discover precise genomic solutions for disease. JAX notes that to date, 26 Nobel prizes have been associated with Jackson Laboratory research, education programs and resources.

&gt; Its research goals are broad, including addiction, aging, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, heart research, immune disease, the microbiome, obesity, rare disease, regenerative medicine, and reproduction and infertility.

&gt; Part of what is being done with the mice is that older mice, which means between the ages of 18 and 24 months, are tested in mazes to test cognitive abilities. The mice are then put on low-calorie diets to determine if they live longer—they do—and also test them in group living arrangements to evaluate the impact of social networks.

&gt; Another researcher, Richard Miller, associate director for research at the University of Michigan Geriatrics Center, is researching how to slow mice aging using drugs. His center has about 5,000 mice, most born and raised there. Yoda, a long-lived mutant Snell dwarf mouse, was the first of his to reach the age of four years.

&gt; The WSJ writes, “Although aged mice are important for research, supply is limited and cost is high. The National Institute on Aging, which has an Aged Rodent Colonies Handbook, provides older mice for projects directly related to aging, but limits researchers to 20 a month, per NIA grant. All mice must be ordered through its online Rodent Ordering System; replacements are offered for animals that arrive dead or die within 48 hours. Those with a ‘scruffy or unkempt appearance,’ which is often normal with aging in mice, won’t be replaced.”

&gt; JAX distributes about 3 million mice per year, all “shelf-ready.” But elderly mice are more expensive. For example, a 78-week-old female mouse from JAX runs $307.14 compared to $74.23 for a 25-week-old one. The Jackson Lab also offers “just-in-time service,” meaning they raise mice to a specific age and then deliver them.

&gt; Churchill notes that, although aged mice are expensive, the scientific contributions are priceless. He told the WSJ, “The big question we have is: Do animals and people age at different rates?”

&gt; He doesn’t mean comparing people to mice, but rather, whether individuals (of their own species) age differently. But aging mice, such as Yoda, Blanche and Grace and all their cousins, are helping find out why.

&gt; Dr. Verdin is CEO and president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, Calif. When the institute opened in 1999, it was the world’s first biomedical research institution devoted solely to research on aging - studying the biology of aging, yielding insights into age-related diseases before they start - all which revolves around helping people live better longer. He also is director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Aging Research at the Buck Institute.

&gt; Dr. Verdin’s laboratory focuses on the role of chemical changes in the cell related to the aging process.

&gt; His laboratory was the first to clone a family of enzymes and demonstrate how metabolism, diet, and small molecules regulate the activity of the enzymes and proteins, and thereby the aging process itself and its associated diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. He has published more than 210 scientific papers and holds more than 15 patents.
&gt;  
&gt; His talk will be about mitochondrial sirtuins and aging. Sirtuins are a new family of proteins identified by his lab that affect aging.
&gt;  
&gt; ""Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell,"" Dr. Verdin said. ""We have identified a new family of proteins that maintains their integrity and allows them to power the organism. These proteins are called sirtuins, and they are critically dependent on a cell compound called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).

&gt; ""We have further found that NAD becomes depleted during aging, which contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and degradation of energy generation as we age.""

&gt; Dr. Verdin said he and his team are trying to understand how NAD becomes depleted during aging and how it might be restored.

&gt; ""We are working on two distinct approaches. First, we have identified a key enzyme that degrades NAD during aging. Second, we are working on NAD precursors that can boost NAD levels and restore mitochondrial function,"" he said.

&gt; Dr. Verdin also serves as an adjunct professor at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles and at the University of California San Francisco. Most recently, from 2004 to 2016, he served as associate director at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, where he also served as senior researcher from 1997 to 2016. From 1998 to 2016, he was a professor at the University of California San Francisco.

&gt; A study led by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine has uncovered a new strategy that can potentially treat age-related disease and decline. The study, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, demonstrates that shortening of telomeres -- the ends of the chromosomes -- impairs a class of enzymes called sirtuins, which play an important role in maintaining cell fitness by affecting many metabolic processes and repairing damaged chromosomes. The researchers showed that restoring the activity of sirtuins with a small compound stabilized telomeres and reduced DNA damage, which in turn improved liver disease in a mouse model. These studies suggest that maintaining telomere length might help sustain the regenerative capacity of cells and tissues and improve disease outcome.

&gt; ""Our genetic material is tightly packed into thread-like structures called chromosomes and at the ends of the chromosomes are particular pieces of DNA called telomeres. Telomeres work like the plastic tips at the end of shoelaces; they prevent chromosomes from unraveling or sticking to each other,"" said Dr. Ergun Sahin, lead investigator and assistant professor in the Huffington Center on Aging and the Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at Baylor.

&gt; Telomeres also are involved in aging and disease; as an organism gets older, telomeres shorten and cells progressively deteriorate, stop dividing and die. Telomere shortening during human aging is believed to be a major underlying cause of age-related decline of stem cells -- cells with the potential to develop into many different types of cells and help in the healing process in the body. Telomere shortening also affects the susceptibility of tissues to disease; however, how telomere shortening impairs regeneration and increases risk of disease is not well understood. Evidence suggests that stabilizing telomeres could prevent or slow down aging and disease. In this study, Sahin and his colleagues investigated the effect of restoring telomere length in a mouse model of liver tissue fibrosis

&gt; Telomere shortening has been associated with increased risk of organ failure and tissue fibrosis, usually in liver and lung, as cells with compromised telomeres fail to divide to replace dying cells.

&gt; Previous studies have shown that both telomeres and sirtuins contribute to aging and tissue fibrosis and seemed to interact with each other. In this study, Sahin and his colleagues investigated the molecular mechanisms that connected telomeres and sirtuins. For this, they developed a mouse model of liver disease in which the animals were genetically engineered to develop shorter, dysfunctional telomeres and age prematurely. When exposed to certain compounds, these animals quickly develop liver fibrosis -- scarring of the liver that over time can lead to cirrhosis.

&gt; ""In these mice, we discovered that shorter telomeres triggered a reduction in the production of sirtuins in liver and other tissues as well,"" Sahin said. ""Telomere shortening signaled the cell to reduce the production of sirtuins. This observation indicates that telomeres regulate sirtuins.""

&gt; Interestingly, the researchers also found that in turn, sirtuins can affect telomeres. When Sahin and his colleagues increased the activity of sirtuins by feeding mice a small molecule -- nicotinamide mono mononucleotide, or NMN, an NAD+ precursor -- telomeres were stabilized.

&gt; ""Furthermore, feeding NAD+ precursor to the mice not only maintained telomere length but also improved liver condition in these mice,"" Sahin said.

&gt; More research is needed before these findings can be translated into treatments for human conditions.

&gt; ""It's important to keep in mind that telomere length can also affect cancer growth. Having shorter telomeres would set cancer cells on a path to self-destruction, but keeping their telomeres long would likely allow them to continue proliferating,"" Sahin said. ""We plan to continue our investigation on the molecular mechanisms involved in the telomere-sirtuin interactions in order to better understand the benefits as well as the potential risks of telomere length manipulation in health and disease.""

If you notice the skin of people who are much older it can become quite thin and when you pinch it, it doesn't spring back so quickly. It's all that fat embedded in collagen that makes flesh springy. Over time it disappears. 

Figuring out something as seemingly trivial as how to keep skin supple could  have profound implications for longevity because skin condition is not trivial at all. When looked at as a single organ, our skin is the largest one we have.

&gt; BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - University of Alabama at Birmingham aging expert -- and once-upon-a-time lion trainer -- Steven Austad, Ph.D., and UAB postdoctoral fellow in longevity research Jessica Hoffman, Ph.D., have won the George C. Williams prize from the International Society for Evolution, Medicine and Public Health, or ISEMPH.

&gt; The prize includes a $5,000 honorarium and an expense-paid trip to the ISEMPH Fifth Annual Meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, this summer.

&gt; ""She gets the paid trip,"" Austad said of his postdoc Hoffman. ""I told her she can have the money if I can have the plaque.""

&gt; The prize recognizes the best paper published in the journal Evolution, Medicine and Public Health in 2018. It commemorates noted evolutionary biologist George Williams, who wrote perhaps the most influential paper in the evolutionary biology of aging in the 20th century, ""Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence.""

&gt; In Williams' 1957 paper, he proposed that antagonistic pleiotropy undergirded the evolution of senescence. The words antagonistic pleiotropy may sound daunting, but they explain a simple concept -- a change in one gene that differentially affects two traits of an organism, one for the better and one for the worse. In aging, antagonistic pleiotropy refers to healthful effects of a gene early in life but harmful effects in later life.

&gt; In their prize-winning paper last year, Austad and Hoffman described the genetic evidence that has accumulated since Williams' mid-century hypothesis. Trade-offs between early life fitness and late life mortality are common, they say, and perhaps ubiquitous.

&gt; They showed examples from fieldwork where wild animals show a negative relationship between reproduction rates early in life and extended lifespan. Although the genetic bases of these examples in vertebrates have not been determined, the longer lifespan comes at the cost of lower fecundity early in life, and that means being dealt a losing card in the contest of evolution.

&gt; For lab organisms, many mutations are known that extend lifespan. Those also examined for antagonistic pleiotropy commonly show a diminished early life fitness that makes them unable to compete -- on the evolutionary scale -- with wild-type organisms.

&gt; For example, a particular mutation in the nematode C. elegans that doubles lifespan also decreases reproduction by one-fifth. When worms with this mutation compete with wild-type worms, they become extinct within a handful of generations.

&gt; Austad and Hoffman listed similar examples in their paper for fruit flies and mice.

&gt; ""From current evidence,"" they wrote, ""antagonistic pleiotropy is somewhere between very common or ubiquitous throughout the animal world. Whenever an allele or new mutation is discovered to extend life, some detrimental effect on early life fitness is almost always observed. This explains why longevity alleles are not favored in wild populations.""

&gt; But that contrasts with the current field of aging research in humans. Here, the desire is to remain healthy and reach a longer lifespan, which antagonistic pleiotropy suggests are mutually exclusive. This research is on the verge of major advances to extend longevity, they say; but the medical interventions used to prolong human health would likely be made later in life. ""Thus, evolutionary biology,"" they said, ""does not preclude the possibility of medical interventions in the aging process.""

&gt; As well as interesting research, Austad and Hoffman have interesting backgrounds.

&gt; Austad graduated with a degree in English literature and worked as a reporter, taxi driver and wild animal trainer. Training lions for movies awakened his interest in earning a Ph.D. degree in biology. He turned to the biology of aging only after extensive fieldwork in the United States, South America, Africa and islands of the west Pacific. His 1997 book, ""Why We Age,"" was translated into eight languages.

&gt; Hoffman graduated summa cum laude from Clemson University, where she wrote her honors thesis on the predator-prey relationship between the northern striped dogwinkle sea snail and acorn barnacles. Her current research interests include the different metabolic pathways associated with age.

&gt; Austad is distinguished professor and chair of the Department of Biology in the UAB College of Arts and Sciences. He also directs of the UAB Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging.

,Traitor_Donald_Trump,"Bogdanov was convinced that the secret to human rejuvenation, and possible immortality, lay in a solidarity-based exchange of blood from the young to the old. He began to formulate this theory in his 1908 utopian science fiction novel “Red Star” by imagining a communist society on Mars using blood rejuvenation as “a comradely vital exchange that goes beyond ideology to the physiological sphere.”

&gt; In 1926, Bogdanov founded the Institute for Hematology and Blood Transfusions in the newly founded Soviet Union to begin experimenting with human rejuvenation. He experimented largely on himself — participating 11 times in experimental blood exchanges by the beginning of 1928 — and noted that following multiple treatments, his eyesight improved, his balding was suspended and friends commented that he looked 10 years younger.

&gt; However, in the spring of 1928, Bogdanov decided to exchange blood with a student who was suffering from malaria and tuberculosis in an attempt to assist with the student’s affliction. Although the student ended up making a full recovery after the transfusion, Bogdanov suffered a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Two weeks later, he was dead at the age of 54.

&gt; Bogdanov’s research intrigued Soviet scientists of the day, but his legacy was suppressed by Stalin, who found his experimentation with blood rejuvenation too utopian and an ideological threat to the state-sanctioned Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Despite this, his work influenced many in the Soviet leadership, bringing to their attention the benefits of transfusion medicine, particularly within the military. In the mid-1930s, before the outset of World War II, the Soviet Union had already developed a system of national centralized blood banks, something no other country had at the time.

This draws the bigger picture together with what Jeffery Epstein has been accused of.

&gt; * Researchers predict 1.4 million deaths from all cancers in 2019 in the EU  
&gt; * Overall death rates from breast cancer fall in the EU, but rise in Poland  

&gt; Death rates from breast cancer are predicted to fall in all European Union (EU) countries in 2019 with the exception of Poland, according to new research published in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology [1] today (Tuesday).

&gt; In their annual predictions for cancer deaths in the EU, Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor at the School of Medicine, University of Milan (Italy), and colleagues predict that this year death rates from breast cancer will fall by nearly nine per cent in the EU as a whole compared to 2014. In Poland they will rise by just over two per cent.

&gt; However, the researchers warn that although age standardised death rates [2] from breast cancer have fallen from 14.6 per 100,000 of the population in 2014 to a predicted 13.4 per 100,000 in 2019, the actual numbers of deaths from the disease continue to rise due to the increasing numbers of elderly people. Breast cancer remains the second highest cancer killer in women after lung cancer.

&gt; ""In 2014 there were 92,000 deaths from breast cancer in Europe and in 2019 we are predicting 92,800,"" said Prof La Vecchia. ""This means the burden of the disease will continue to increase, with consequent implications for public health and costs to society.

&gt; ""The improvements in death rates from breast cancer are due to national screening programmes, early diagnosis and improvements in the management and treatment of the disease. The most favourable trends were in women aged 50-69, which is the age group generally targeted by organised screening.""

&gt; Compared to the period between 2010-2014, age standardised death rates from breast cancer are predicted to fall by 16% in 2019 in women aged between 50-69 years, but by only 6% in women aged between 70-79 years.

&gt; ""The implementation of population-based organised breast cancer screening in the EU has greatly improved between 2007 and 2016 with many more countries implementing programmes and many more women being screened. Thus, it may be too early to observe a beneficial effect from this in the 70-79 age group. This may also be the age group that benefits least from improvements in therapies as other health conditions and problems may prevent their use in older women,"" said Prof La Vecchia

&gt; ""Poland and other eastern European countries do not have favourable predicted patterns in breast cancer deaths, suggesting the need to improve breast cancer diagnosis and treatment in these countries.""

&gt; The researchers looked at cancer death rates in the EU 28 Member States [3] as a whole and also in the six largest countries - France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK - for all cancers, and, individually, for stomach, intestines, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus (including cervix), ovary, prostate, bladder and leukaemias for men and women [4]. This is the ninth consecutive year the researchers have published these predictions. Prof La Vecchia and his colleagues had collected data on deaths from the World Health Organization from 1970 to 2014.

&gt; Of the six largest countries, the UK has the greatest predicted decrease in breast cancer deaths for 2019 (13%), followed by France (10%), Germany (9%), Italy (7%), Spain (5%), while in Poland there is a predicted 2% increase.

&gt; The researchers predict there will be 1.4 million deaths from all cancers in the EU in 2019 (787,000 in men, 621,900 in women), an increase of about 4.8% from 1.35 million in 2014. But there will be decline in the age standardised rate from 139 per 100,000 men in 2014 to 131 per 100,000 in 2019 (a 6% fall) and from 86 per 100,000 women to 83 per 100,000 women (a 3.6% fall).

&gt; Lung cancer remains the biggest killer in both sexes, with 183,200 deaths in men predicted for 2019 and 96,800 predicted in women. In men the death rates are falling, from 36 per 100,000 in 2014 to 32 per 100,000 in 2019 (9% drop). However, the rates are still rising in women from 14.2 per 100,00 in 2014 to a predicted 14.8 per 100,000 in 2019 (4% increase).

&gt; Of the ten cancers the researchers investigated, pancreatic cancer was the only other not showing a favourable trend. In men rates will be stable in 2019 (age standardised rate of 7.92 per 100,000; 45,600 deaths), while in women there will be an increase of 1.6% (age standardised rate of 5.57 per 100,000; 45,100 deaths). [4]

&gt; ""This probably reflects the different trends in smoking, which is the main risk factor for this cancer,"" said Prof La Vecchia. ""In addition, overweight and diabetes - which are linked to pancreatic cancer - have increased, and progress in this cancer is hampered by the fact that research into preventing and treating it is underfunded, particularly because there are few long-term survivors and, consequently, few patient advocates pressing for improvements.""

&gt; The researchers say that compared to a peak rate of cancer deaths in 1988, over five million cancer deaths have been avoided in the EU in the 31-year period up to 2019. Of these, 440,000 deaths from breast cancer were prevented. In 2019 alone, a total of 360,000 deaths from cancer are predicted to be avoided (237,000 in men and 122,000 in women).

&gt; Co-author, Fabio Levi (MD), Emeritus Professor at the Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne (Switzerland), said: ""Lung cancer trends have long been declining in European men. However, they are less favourable than US ones. Over 20% of European adults still smoke, as compared to less than 15% in the USA. This calls for urgent interventions on tobacco for men and women in the EU.""

&gt; Editor-in-chief of Annals of Oncology, Professor Fabrice André, Professor in the Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France, commented: ""These annual predictions for cancer deaths in Europe produced by Carlo La Vecchia and colleagues provide invaluable information for policy-makers in order to help them provide appropriate medical services in their countries. It is clear that despite the good news that death rates are declining in most cancers, the bad news is that, due to growing and aging populations, the number of people who will die from cancer is increasing. This represents a significant burden on society, and more needs to be done to prevent cancers occurring in the first place, particularly by reducing the numbers of people who smoke and are overweight.""

As for longevity and metformin:

Based on research in animals and in-vitro, the thought is that [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) can extend healthspan, and maybe lifespan.  See the [TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) clinical trial FAQ for more.](https://www.afar.org/natgeo/).   

Others argue that the benefit may be marginal (which is [suggested by the NIA funded ITP1](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Met/C2011),  but the real benefit is if it bolsters support for aging to be recognised as a disease target from a regulatory point of view.  On sourcing: Most would prefer to get it by prescription, rather than from potential fake sources from online overseas pharmacies.   Note: It is against reddit rules to request sources for prescription drugs outside of going to a doctor.  Doctors may be skeptical around prescribing, in case side effects occur, they could be litigated for malpractice prescribing metformin outside of its normal indication.

A lot of interest around metformin in humans came from this paper: [Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without? A comparison of mortality in people initiated with metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy and matched, non-diabetic controls (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041462) 

This paper has met criticism around whether there were differences in the groups that led to the outcomes unrelated to metformin:

* http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-type-2-diabetes-metformin-and-lifespan/

* https://pubpeer.com/publications/4E29C6C9E32D2C24662AED78A59AC5


Open questions: Is metformin a type of exercise mimetic?  How much of metformin's benefit could be achieved by lifestyle interventions such as exercise?  Both overlap in activating the [Nrf2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770706) and [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase#Exercise/training) cellular pathways.


This is not a complete dismissal of metformin, as mechanisms may exist for improving health, but they have yet to be clearly elucidated to the point of being a strong evidence based recommendation.  It is more a reminder to know about the grade of evidence available to date.  The TAME trial may be able to reveal more fine grained effects in humans if sufficient biomarkers exist and are chosen for detecting differences in age related pathology.   See next paper:

&gt; ""Our findings expose a recent change that could serve as a warning of an increased burden of obesity-related cancers to come in older adults,"" says Dr Ahmedin Jemal from the American Cancer Society, USA. ""Most cancers occur in older adults, which means that as the young people in our study age, the burden of obesity-related cancer cases and deaths are likely to increase even more. On the eve of World Cancer Day, it's timely to consider what can be done to avert the impending rise."" 

&gt; An observational study using data covering more than half of the US population suggests that incidence rates of cancers linked to obesity are increasing most rapidly in young adults. The findings, published in The Lancet Public Health journal on World Cancer Day, could indicate that an even greater disease burden is on the horizon.

&gt; The study suggests that the sharpest increase in obesity-related cancer incidence is in adults aged 25 to 49. This was true for half of the 12 cancers classified as related to obesity: colorectal, uterine corpus, gallbladder, kidney, pancreatic, and multiple myeloma (a type of bone marrow cancer). Patients were divided into five-year age groups from 25-29 to 80-84 years old. Each successively younger age group experienced a greater percentage increase. Of the 18 other types of cancers included in the study only two showed a similar trend while eight - mostly related to smoking, infection, or both - showed a decline, and the rest remained stable.

&gt; Despite these increases in risk, the authors note that the overall incidence of these cancers remains higher in older age groups than in younger age groups.


&gt; Most epidemiological studies have focused on older populations so the effect on cancer risk of excess bodyweight in early life, or of weight gain in young adulthood, is not well understood. In some cancers, excess bodyweight during early adulthood could be a more important influence on cancer risk than weight gain in later life [2]. This is the first study to examine contemporary incidence trends in young adults for a comprehensive list of cancers in the United States.

&gt; The researchers analysed incidence data from 25 state cancer registries, covering 67% of the US population. They considered 30 of the most common cancer types, including 12 obesity-related cancers [3] in people aged 25 to 84 years, diagnosed between 1995 and 2014. During this timeframe, there were 14,672,409 cases of the 30 types of cancer. [4]

&gt; Incidence of multiple myeloma and cancers of the colorectum, uterine corpus, gallbladder, kidney, pancreas, and thyroid increased in younger adults (25 to 49 years). Incidences also rose in older adults, except for colorectal cancer, but by a smaller percentage. [4] The younger the age group, the greater the size of the increase - in all seven of the cancer types except for thyroid cancer. For example, in pancreatic cancer the average annual change was equal or less than 1% in people aged 40 to 84, 1.3% in those aged 35 to 39, and 2.5% in 30 to 34-year-olds. In the youngest age group (of 25 to 29 years), it was 4.3%. Across the six cancer types, the annual increase ranged from 0.4% in uterine corpus cancer to 3.0% in kidney cancer amongst 45 to 49-year-olds, and from 1.4% for multiple myeloma up to 6.2% in kidney cancer in 25 to 29 year-olds (see Figure 3 for trends in age-specific incidence rates for the 12 obesity-related cancers between 1995-2014).

&gt; While the rates are increasing more quickly in younger adults, it is important to note that overall incidence is lower than in older adults where the majority of cancers are diagnosed. For example, around two pancreatic cancer cases were diagnosed in every 100,000 25-49 year-old persons per year between 2010-2014, compared with around 37 in every 100,000 50-84 year olds [4].

&gt; In contrast to the other obesity-related cancers, the risk of developing breast cancer generally remained unchanged in younger generations. This could reflect the fact that some types of breast cancer are on the rise while others in decline. The authors suggest that other factors could also be at play, such as changes in screening practice and women's reproductive factors including age at first full-term pregnancy and number of children.

&gt; Overall, the findings could reflect the obesity epidemic of the past 40 years. Obesity rates have more than doubled in the US between 1984 and 2014. Obesity is now one of the most preventable causes of cancer in both the US and the UK - around 1 in 12 cases in the US are caused by excess weight and more than 1 in 20 in the UK.

&gt; ""Over the past few decades, death rates have been in decline for most cancers, but in the future obesity could reverse that progress, barring any interventions. Younger generations are experiencing earlier and longer-lasting exposure to excess fat and to obesity-related health conditions that can increase cancer risk."" says Dr Jemal. [1]

&gt; Lead author Dr Hyuna Sung of the American Cancer Society, USA, says: ""Obesity is associated with health conditions that can contribute to the risk of cancer. For example, diabetes, gallstones, inflammatory bowel disease, and poor diet can all increase the burden of cancer. The quality of the American diet also has worsened in recent decades. More than half of adults who were 20 to 49 years old between 2010 to 2012 reported poor dietary habits, such as eating little fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and shellfish at the same time as eating too much salt, fast food, and sugary drinks."" [1]

&gt; The authors call for increased obesity screening. Fewer than half of primary care physicians regularly assess body mass index in their patients - despite national recommendations for screening. Only a third of people who are obese report receiving a diagnosis or weight loss counselling. The authors suggest that restrictions on advertising calorie-dense food and drinks, taxes on sugary drinks and urban planning that promotes physical activity could be effective strategies to stem the emerging trend.

&gt; The researchers note that they were not able to quantify the impact of new modes of detection - such as highly sensitive diagnostic imaging - on emerging cancer incidence trends in young generations. However, screening is less common in younger adults, while increases in cancer incidence were still greater. The study does not provide evidence of a causal relationship between obesity and cancer. Additional experimental and population-based studies will be needed to test the hypothesis more directly.

[Mean telomere length is not associated with current health status in a 50-year-old population sample (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.22906)

&gt; Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeric DNA decreases with age and shows considerable heterogeneity in the wider population. There is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health. This study examined the effectiveness of telomere length as a biomarker for an individual's current overall health status by assessing several measures of general health including SF-36v2 score, current smoking status and a comprehensive obesity phenotype. Participants were from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Lifecourse (CHALICE) cohort, a New Zealand population based multidisciplinary study of aging. Telomere length measurements were obtained on DNA from 351 peripheral blood samples at age 49-51, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

&gt; No associations were found between telomere length measured at age 49-51 and any measures of current health status. The only significant association observed was between telomere length and gender, with females having longer telomere length than men. Our results suggest that telomere length measurements are unlikely to provide information of much predictive significance for an individual's health status.

[Analysis of the Association Between TERC and TERT Genetic Variation and Leukocyte Telomere Length and Human Lifespan—A Follow-Up Study (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/2/82/htm)

&gt; The association between lifespan and LTL at baseline was analyzed in a subsample of 163 subjects. Age at baseline was inversely associated with LTL (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean LTL was greater in the subjects still living than in those no longer living at follow-up (0.79 T/S ± 0.09 vs. 0.63 T/S ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of age classes showed that, among the 70–79-year-olds, the difference in mean LTL between those still living and those no longer living at follow-up was greater than among the 80–90-year-olds.  
&gt; Our data provide evidence that shorter LTL at baseline may predict a shorter lifespan, but the reliability of LTL as a lifespan biomarker seems to be limited to a specific age (70–79 years).

&gt; New Orleans, LA - Older men tend to have lower biological age if they have higher levels of sex hormones, particularly the estradiol form of estrogen, a large new study from Australia finds. The study results will be presented on Sunday at ENDO 2019, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in New Orleans, La., and appear online in the journal Clinical Endocrinology.

&gt; “As populations grow older and sicker, identifying pathways to healthier aging is important,” said the study’s lead investigator, Bu Yeap, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., a professor at the University of Western Australia’s medical school in Perth. “Sex hormones such as testosterone and its active metabolite, estradiol, may reflect or possibly determine biological youth.”

&gt; Some people have a lower or higher biological age than their actual chronological age, and slower biological aging is a measure of a person’s ability to remain healthier and live longer. One way to measure biological age is the length of telomeres, which are DNA-protein complexes located at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age, leading to cellular dysfunction. Past research shows that stress, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet can also shorten telomeres, but the effect of sex hormones on telomeres was uncertain, Yeap said.

&gt; The researchers studied data from 2,913 men aged 70 to 89 years who lived in the community and not long-term-care facilities. The investigators measured telomeres in DNA from white blood cells using a molecular biology method called quantitative polymerase chain reaction. They measured sex hormones taken from blood samples using an accurate technique called mass spectrometry.

&gt; The research team found that the higher the estradiol level, the longer the telomeres were likely to be, indicating lower biological age. This remained true even after the researchers adjusted for actual age, lifestyle factors and existing medical conditions. Yeap cautioned, however, that their study results show only an association and not necessarily a cause.

&gt; “Our finding will facilitate future studies aimed at preserving health in the growing demographic of aging men,” Yeap said. “If future research finds that sex hormone exposure modulates biological aging in men, we would need to test the effect on biological age of giving men testosterone, which is then converted to estradiol. The optimal blood level of estradiol in older men also would need to be determined.”

&gt; In older men, neither T nor DHT is associated with LTL while E2 is independently associated with LTL and SHBG is inversely associated, thus relating sex hormone exposure to lower biological age. Further research is needed to determine causality and clarify the role of sex hormones in male ageing.",1,1553545811,longevity

There is no clear evidence to date that Metformin will extend lifespan in humans.  We are still waiting to see when a clinical trial will start, if at all.   In the mean time, there are clinical trials of therapies that are argued to be better: https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/ which may only be years away.   



The benefit to metformin may be marginal if the data on mice is anything to go on, (which is [suggested by the NIA funded ITP1](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Met/C2011).

Recent interest around metformin in humans came from this paper: [Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without? A comparison of mortality in people initiated with metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy and matched, non-diabetic controls (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041462) 

This paper has met criticism around whether there were differences in the groups that led to the outcomes unrelated to metformin:

* https://pubpeer.com/publications/4E29C6C9E32D2C24662AED78A59AC5

Open questions: Is metformin a type of exercise mimetic?  How much of metformin's benefit could be achieved by lifestyle interventions such as exercise?  Both overlap in activating the [Nrf2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770706) and [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase#Exercise/training) cellular pathways.   

If you are healthy (exercising regularly, and don't have issues with blood sugar (prediabetes)) maybe there is minimal to no benefit.  We already know that metformin decreases gains in response to exercise in elderly people, it could do the same in young: 

https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article/2/suppl_1/544/5169519

&gt; DXA showed that lean mass increased overall (P &lt; 0.0001), with the metformin group gaining significantly less lean mass than the placebo group (P &lt; 0.01). 

This is not a complete dismissal of metformin, as mechanisms may exist for improving health, but they have yet to be clearly elucidated to the point of being a strong evidence based recommendation.  It is more a reminder to know about the grade of evidence available to date.  The TAME  (targeting aging with metformin) 
 trial may be able to reveal more fine grained effects in humans if sufficient biomarkers exist and are chosen for detecting differences in age related pathology, or we will only know whether it decreases time to death from any cause in aged people.

The most recent update on the proposed TAME trial can be found here if you want more information: [A framework for selection of blood-based biomarkers for geroscience-guided clinical trials: report from the TAME Biomarkers Workgroup (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151729).  

Arguably, stopping binge drinking could have more of an effect on lifespan if you are drinking excessively.   You also wouldn't be able to take metformin and drink at the same time without risk of serious side effects.
 

Since you ask about berberine, it's less well researched and not researched at all for longevity like metformin is. 

Metformin has been put through studies on lifespan in mice as shown above, but not for berberine.   For example: Diabetics or pre-diabetics might use berberine and see some improvement in management of their condition, but that is not evidence for longevity claims.   

While some suggest that berberine overlaps with metformin because it activates [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase), many things do this, but due to the concepts of [on-target and off-target effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23085982) (drugs doing too much of a good thing or unrelated things), berberine could have unique effects that may be detrimental to overall lifespan.  This is why studies are needed to validate the compound in mammals, such as in the [NIA's ITP](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-program-itp).  To date, no such study exists for berberine.

Again, the positive effects might be seen from exercise alone, and could even be better.

,shrillthrill,"&gt; ""This is the first study to show that changes in the gut microbiome with aging have an adverse impact on vascular health,"" said lead author Vienna Brunt, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Integrative Physiology. ""It opens up a whole new avenue of potential interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease.""

&gt; For the study, published in the Journal of Physiology, researchers gave young mice and old mice broad-spectrum antibiotics to kill off the majority of bacteria living in their gut, aka their gut microbiome. Then they assessed the health of their vascular endothelium (the inner lining of their blood vessels) and the stiffness of their large arteries.

&gt; They also measured blood levels of inflammatory compounds, tissue-damaging free-radicals, antioxidants and the blood-vessel-expanding compound nitric oxide in both groups.

&gt; After three to four weeks of the treatment, the young mice saw no change in vascular health. The old mice, however, saw vast improvements on all measures.

&gt; ""When you suppressed the microbiome of the old mice, their vascular health was restored to that of young mice,"" said senior author and professor Doug Seals, director of the Integrative Physiology of Aging Laboratory. ""This suggests there is something about those microorganisms that is causing vascular dysfunction.""

To assess what that something may be, the researchers then took fecal samples from another set of mice and had them genetically sequenced, comparing the gut bacteria living in the old mice with that in the young.

""In general, in the old mice, we saw an increased prevalence of microbes that are pro-inflammatory and have been previously associated with diseases,"" Brunt said.

For instance, the old mice hosted significantly more Proteobacteria, a phyla that includes Salmonella and other pathogens, and pro-inflammatory Desulfovibrio.

To drill down further, the researchers measured blood levels of metabolites -- small molecules produced by the gut microorganisms and absorbed into the bloodstream -- in old and young mice.

Old mice had three times as much TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a metabolite shown in previous studies to be linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke.

As early as 45, risk of cardiovascular disease begins to creep up, according to the American Heart Association. By age 60-79, 70 percent of people in the United States have it. After age 80, fewer than one in five are free of it.

But just what causes healthy arteries to stiffen and lose function with age has remained somewhat of a medical mystery.

&gt; ""We have long known that oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in making arteries unhealthy over time, but we didn't know why arteries begin to get inflamed and stressed. Something is triggering this,"" Seals said. ""We now suspect that, with age, the gut microbiota begins producing toxic molecules, including TMAO, which get into the blood stream, cause inflammation and oxidative stress and damage tissue.""

&gt; Seals and Brunt stress that they are absolutely not suggesting people use antibiotics as a cardiovascular fountain of youth.

&gt; ""We purely used antibiotics as an experimental tool. There are far too many side-effects and other problems with using it broadly,"" Brunt said.

&gt; They're also studying a compound called dimethyl butanol, found in some olive oils, vinegars and red wines, which blocks the bacterial enzyme required to produce TMAO. Ultimately, it could be developed into a dietary supplement.

&gt; The good news is that properly caring for the skin with a moisturizing cream may lower inflammation levels and potentially prevent age-related diseases, according to a new clinical pilot study.

&gt; As humans get older, we experience a low-level of inflammation—dubbed “inflamm-aging”—driven by an increase in molecules in the blood called cytokines. This age-related inflammation has been linked to serious chronic diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Scientists initially thought that the inflammation stemmed from the immune system or the liver, but a group of dermatologists at UCSF have a different theory.

&gt; “The inflammation must come from an organ big enough that very minor inflammation can affect the whole body. Skin is a good candidate for this because of its size,” said study senior author Mao-Qiang Man, MD, a research scientist in the UCSF Department of Dermatology, who is based at the San Francisco VA Health Care System and is also a visiting professor at Southern Medical University in Guangzhou, China. “Once we get old, we have dermatological symptoms like itchiness, dryness, and changes in acidity. It could be that the skin has very minor inflammation, and because it’s such a large organ it elevates circulating cytokine levels.”

&gt; Our skin starts to deteriorate around age 50 with changes to epidermal pH, hydration, and the permeability barrier, which keeps water in and bacteria and other potential pathogens out. A loss of moisture and breaks in the permeability barrier cause the skin to release inflammatory cytokines. Ordinarily, these cytokines help to repair defects in the barrier, but in aging skin the barrier can’t be fixed as easily, so the inflammatory signals continue to be released, eventually reaching the blood.

&gt; “Until recently, the scientific community didn’t believe that skin could contribute to systemic inflammation and disease. But in the last five years, studies of psoriasis and dermatitis have shown that skin inflammation from these diseases likely increases the risk of heart disease,"" said study lead author Theodora Mauro, MD, a professor of dermatology at UCSF and the San Francisco VA Health Care System. “Aging skin is much more common than psoriasis or dermatitis, so the overall risk to the population from aging skin could far outweigh that seen from skin diseases. Decreasing inflammation simply by treating the skin dysfunction seen in aging could have profound health effects.”

&gt; In [the study (paywalled), published March 5, 2019 in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jdv.15540), Mauro, Man and colleagues attempted to reverse age-related skin damage using an over-the-counter skin cream formulated based on prior research by Man and colleagues, and which the researchers had previously shown to contribute to skin repair based on its beneficial ratio of three types of lipids (cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides) that are vital for skin health.

&gt; Thirty-three older adults between the ages of 58 and 95 applied the cream all over their bodies twice a day for 30 days. After a month, the researchers measured blood levels of three cytokines—interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha—that have all been implicated in age-related inflammatory diseases. Using the cream reduced the amount of all three cytokines compared to both the participants’ levels before using the cream and the levels of similarly aged adults who did not use the cream. In fact, using the cream lowered participants’ cytokine levels to be nearly equivalent with people in their 30s, suggesting that rejuvenating the skin can reverse “inflamm-aging.” The cream also improved skin hydration, lowered pH, and repaired the permeability barrier.

&gt; The scientists now plan to conduct a longer, larger study to test if lowering cytokine levels with the cream can delay or prevent age-related inflammatory diseases.

&gt; “We're going to see whether using the cream to keep epidermal function normal as people age will prevent the development of those downstream diseases,” said co-author Peter Elias, MD, a UCSF professor of dermatology based at the San Francisco VA Health Care System. “If we do, the implication would be that after the age of 50, you would want to be applying an effective topical barrier repair preparation daily for the rest of your life.”

&gt; This game changing capability provides a much more reliable predictor for the status of your immune system than any other method and could lead to fundamental changes in drug &amp; vaccine development and medical practice.

&gt; The immune system is the critical function in the body for managing health. It is a complex system with hundreds of different cell-types. Until now, no metric had existed to quantify an individual's immune status. This ground-breaking new data, while requiring further development, describes a metric (called IMM-AGE) by which we can accurately understand a person's immune status, providing increased information for accurate prediction and management of risks for disease and death.

&gt; This new capability will have major drug development implications: Given the importance of immune status in vaccine response, this new data could play a significant role in both the design of future vaccine trials and in re-evaluating past vaccine trials. Moreover, this new metric for immune aging could see chronological age augmented by ""immune age"" as a way of improving drug development programs - providing for enhanced clinical trial entry/exclusion criteria that can elicit a more homogenous response and greater likelihood of success.

&gt; ""This paper represents a very important step towards developing useful measures of immunological health, helping to identify disease-related risk"", said Prof. Mark M. Davis, Head of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection. ""It's been sixty years since the last immunological benchmarks (Complete Blood Counts) were introduced into general medical practice. This much more sophisticated method reflects the tremendous explosion of knowledge generated in the field.""

&gt; The researchers developed their unique data by following a group of healthy volunteers (135) for nine years, taking annual blood samples which were profiled against a range of 'omics' technologies (cell subset phenotyping, functional responses of cells to cytokine stimulations and whole blood gene expression). This captured population- and individual-level changes to the immune system over time, which when analyzed using a range of novel, immune aligned, machine learning analytical technologies, enabled identification of patterns of cell-subset changes, common to those in the study, despite the large amount of variation in their immune system states. The data and metrics generated was then validated against a cohort of more than 2,000 patients from the Framingham Heart Study

&gt; ""Starting in 2007, this study is really the birthplace of CytoReason - the beginning of the collection of the unique immune-focused data sets and the development of specific technologies to interrogate and transform these highly complex, multi-dimensional data into increased big-picture knowledge and clinically meaningful insights"", said Prof. Shen-Orr, Head of Systems Immunology &amp; Precision Medicine lab at the Technion and Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at CytoReason. ""The immune age is a biological clock that will help to identify in individuals, the decline and progress in immunity that occurs in old age - with the aim of determining preventive measures and developing new treatment modalities to minimize chronic disease and death.""

&gt; BACKGROUND: Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and muscle weakness occur in
&gt; parallel in multiple pathological conditions. However, the causative role of
&gt; skeletal muscle mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) on neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
&gt; morphology and function and muscle weakness has not been directly investigated.
&gt; METHODS: We generated mice lacking skeletal muscle-specific manganese-superoxide 
&gt; dismutase (mSod2KO) to increase mtROS using a cre-Lox approach driven by human
&gt; skeletal actin. We determined primary functional parameters of skeletal muscle
&gt; mitochondrial function (respiration, ROS, and calcium retention capacity) using
&gt; permeabilized muscle fibres and isolated muscle mitochondria. We assessed
&gt; contractile properties of isolated skeletal muscle using in situ and in vitro
&gt; preparations and whole lumbrical muscles to elucidate the mechanisms of
&gt; contractile dysfunction.
&gt; RESULTS: The mSod2KO mice, contrary to our prediction, exhibit a 10-15% increase 
&gt; in muscle mass associated with an ~50% increase in central nuclei and ~35%
&gt; increase in branched fibres (P &lt; 0.05). Despite the increase in muscle mass of
&gt; gastrocnemius and quadriceps, in situ sciatic nerve-stimulated isometric
&gt; maximum-specific force (N/cm2 ), force per cross-sectional area, is impaired by
&gt; ~60% and associated with increased NMJ fragmentation and size by ~40% (P &lt; 0.05).
&gt; Intrinsic alterations of components of the contractile machinery show elevated
&gt; markers of oxidative stress, for example, lipid peroxidation is increased by
&gt; ~100%, oxidized glutathione is elevated by ~50%, and oxidative modifications of
&gt; myofibrillar proteins are increased by ~30% (P &lt; 0.05). We also find an
&gt; approximate 20% decrease in the intracellular calcium transient that is
&gt; associated with specific force deficit. Excess superoxide generation from the
&gt; mitochondrial complexes causes a deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase and
&gt; reduced complex-II-mediated respiration and adenosine triphosphate generation
&gt; rates leading to severe exercise intolerance (~10 min vs. ~2 h in wild type,
&gt; P &lt; 0.05).
&gt; CONCLUSIONS: Increased skeletal muscle mtROS is sufficient to elicit NMJ
&gt; disruption and contractile abnormalities, but not muscle atrophy, suggesting new 
&gt; roles for mitochondrial oxidative stress in maintenance of muscle mass through
&gt; increased fibre branching.

&gt; Elizabeth Blackburn, a biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, who won the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, in 2009, cofounded Telomere Diagnostics in 2010. The company still shows images of a Nobel Prize on its website, but Blackburn left the company more than five years ago because of concerns she had about its products.

&gt; Elissa Epel, another UCSF researcher who cofounded the company with Blackburn, left at the same time for the same reasons.

&gt; Both researchers told Business Insider that they questioned the efficacy of Telomere Diagnostics' test. And a former Telomere Diagnostics employee said she witnessed practices that raised doubts about the company's cleanliness, commitment to scientific accuracy, and handling of private health information.

&gt;  the links between telomere length, health, and aging are not yet clear cut.

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been tied to higher rates of disease, faster tumor growth, and overall age-related degeneration. But longer telomeres have not been tied to the opposite outcomes; several recent studies have failed to find any link between long telomeres and positive health effects, and longer-than-normal telomeres have also been tied to an increased risk of cancer.

&gt; Many activities appear to have the power to grow or blunt telomeres, from exercise to smoking, but scientists have not yet been able to prove that this relationship is causal. That means that we still do not fully understand telomeres or their role in aging and disease. So trying to lengthen or shorten your telomeres as a health intervention is arguably premature and, at worst, harmful, some experts say.

&gt; The average age of the global population is increasing as a result of improved access to healthcare and changes in lifestyle. But, as life expectancy continues to increase, so too do the personal, socio-economic and financial burden of ageing-related diseases. Old age is the greatest risk factor for a number of chronic, progressive diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, cancer and neurodegeneration. Over the past two decades, our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing at the molecular, cellular and organismal level has increased substantially. This improved knowledge now provides a realistic opportunity for us to intervene with the ageing process and to prevent or delay the onset of ageing-associated disorders through lifestyle modification and/or pharmacological and therapeutic interventions.  

&gt; This conference brings together experts from diverse fields of research that explore the mechanisms of ageing and rejuvenation, from the perspective of genetics and epigenetics, cellular quality control and senescence, stem cells, metabolism and brain function. The aim of the conference is to foster interactions and stimulate discussion of recent and unpublished advances in our understanding of the ageing process, and to explore new therapeutic opportunities for the rejuvenation and preservation of organs and tissues to extend healthspan.

**&gt;Aims**

&gt;It is unknown whether different training modalities exert differential cellular effects. Telomeres and telomere-associated proteins play a major role in cellular aging with implications for global health. This prospective training study examines the effects of endurance training, interval training (IT), and resistance training (RT) on telomerase activity and telomere length (TL).

**&gt;Methods and results**

&gt;One hundred and twenty-four healthy previously inactive individuals completed the 6 months study. Participants were randomized to three different interventions or the control condition (no change in lifestyle): aerobic endurance training (AET, continuous running), high-intensive IT (4 × 4 method), or RT (circle training on 8 devices), each intervention consisting of three 45 min training sessions per week. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was increased by all three training modalities. Telomerase activity in blood mononuclear cells was up-regulated by two- to three-fold in both endurance exercise groups (AET, IT), but not with RT. In parallel, lymphocyte, granulocyte, and leucocyte TL increased in the endurance-trained groups but not in the RT group. Magnet-activated cell sorting with telomerase repeat-ampliflication protocol (MACS-TRAP) assays revealed that a single bout of endurance training—but not RT—acutely increased telomerase activity in CD14+ and in CD34+ leucocytes.

**&gt;Conclusion**

&gt;This randomized controlled trial shows that endurance training, IT, and RT protocols induce specific cellular pathways in circulating leucocytes. Endurance training and IT, but not RT, increased telomerase activity and TL which are important for cellular senescence, regenerative capacity, and thus, healthy aging.

&gt; Analysis of genetic data from more than 94,000 individuals has revealed five new risk genes for Alzheimer’s disease, and confirmed 20 known others. An international team of researchers also reports for the first time that mutations in genes specific to tau, a hallmark protein of Alzheimer’s disease, may play an earlier role in the development of the disease than originally thought. These new findings support developing evidence that groups of genes associated with specific biological processes, such as cell trafficking, lipid transport, inflammation and the immune response, are “genetic hubs” that are an important part of the disease process. The study, which was funded in part by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and other components of the National Institutes of Health, follows results from 2013. 

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/data-sharing-uncovers-five-new-risk-genes-alzheimers-disease

&gt; “This continuing collaborative research into the genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer’s is allowing us to dig deeper into the complexities of this devastating disease,” said Richard J. Hodes, M.D., director of the NIA. “The size of this study provides additional clarity on the genes to prioritize as we continue to better understand and target ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer’s.”


&gt; “Having more and more samples in GWAS data sets is like adding more and more pixels to a photograph—it helps researchers see details that they otherwise wouldn’t and helps them decide where to focus further study,” explained Marilyn Miller, Ph.D., director of the Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease program in the Division of Neuroscience at NIA. “If the genes only appear in one out of ten thousand people, you need to find several samples containing those genes for results to be statistically significant.”

&gt; This press release describes a basic research finding. Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology, which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Science is an unpredictable and incremental process — each research advance builds on past discoveries, often in unexpected ways. Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic research.


Regarding the numbers:

&gt; The final sample was 35,274 clinical and autopsy-documented Alzheimer’s disease cases and 59,163 controls.

There's a lot of work being done right now around lp(a) research.  This is a genetic factor that independently increases risk.

There are currently two breakthrough drugs for cardio all around, but they are crazy expensive and injectables:

1.  PCSK9 inhibitors - greatly reduce both LDL-P and lp(a).  Trials saw them effective in as little as 2 years I think which was incredible.  Only really being prescribed for those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) though.  Those people are genetically inclined to high cholesterol and see 400+ numbers.

2. The new antisense drugs are going through trials and might be ready in about 5 years.  These specifically target lp(a).  Anti-sense drugs work by targeting RNA to prevent the protein creation.  Very advanced drugs, but the downside is that the immune system always sees these as foreign invaders.  Unfortunately, also injectables, and probably will end up only being approved for FH.

For most people in the meantime, the best thing you can do is get your LDL-P (NOT LDL-C) tested, or use apoB as a proxy.

Modern treatment mostly involves statins which can help those numbers, but not lp(a) risk.  Statins unfortunately also can increase average blood glucose levels / diabetes risk, but generally seem worth the risk for anyone running higher numbers.

&gt; DW: Your company, neotiv, has developed an app to research neurodegenerative diseases in their early stages. You're also involved with the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). What's the aim of your app, and how does it work?

&gt; Professor Emrah Düzel: The aim is to improve the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the future — that's our global aim. And one of the major hurdles there is that it's very difficult to diagnose, track, and monitor the disease. That makes it very difficult to recognize the early stages of the disease and start prevention in time.

&gt; The app is designed to track the cognitive performance of the participants — Alzheimer's patients and a control group — over a long period of time. Participants also have to answer questionnaires. And you're looking specifically at getting people, ""citizen scientists"" if you like, to track their cognitive performance, even when they've had a bad night's sleep, or they've got the flu. Why?

&gt; Well, first, we want [the app] to become a medical device at some point, one that has a strong basis in science, so that's why we have these ties to the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Then we also want to reach out to the public to inform and empower citizens, so that they know about the early aspects of Alzheimer's. And we want to empower science. One of the hardest aspects of Alzheimer's research is understanding the impact of intermittent health conditions on the main symptom of the disease, which is memory impairment.

&gt; There are so many intermittent and unpredictable health events that it's hard for science to know their effect. But you can't just have people come into a clinic when they've got flu.

&gt; How does your app compare to traditional cognitive performance tests, pen-and-paper tests, which, we've learnt, have issues, such as cultural biases or so-called learning effects, where if you know the test, you'll know how to answer, and that can skew the results?

&gt; Those existing tests were designed 30 or 40 years ago at a time when we didn't really know how the brain works. But now we have a very clear idea of where the disease starts in the brain and how it progresses. So we can design tests in such a way that they first address the brain areas that are affected initially, and then consider how the disease might progress. And that's what we've done. 

&gt; We've also designed the tests so that they can be used in many different countries, so that they don't depend on a [person's language skills]. 

&gt; The idea is that our app will give general practitioners (GPs) and other health professionals, and scientists, a probability as to whether a person has a form of Alzheimer's in their brain.

Abstract:

&gt; **Background**  
&gt; Age is one of the strongest predictors of cancer, chronic disease and mortality, but biological responses to aging differ among people. Epigenetic DNA modifications have been used to estimate “biological age,” which may be a useful predictor of disease risk. We test this hypothesis for breast cancer.

&gt; **Methods**  
&gt; Using a case-cohort approach, we measured baseline blood DNA methylation of 2,764 women enrolled in the Sister Study, 1,566 of whom subsequently developed breast cancer after an average of six years. Using three previously established methylation-based “clocks” (Hannum, Horvath, and Levine) we defined biological age acceleration for each woman by comparing her estimated biological age with her chronological age. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer risk were estimated using Cox regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.

&gt; **Results**
&gt; Each of the three clocks showed that biological age acceleration was statistically significantly associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer (5 year age acceleration, Hannum’s clock: HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.21, P= 0.04; Horvath’s clock: HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.17, P= 0.04; Levine’s clock: HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.23, P &lt; 0.001 ). For Levine’s clock, each five-year acceleration in biological age corresponded with a 15% increase in breast cancer risk. Although biological age may accelerate with menopausal transition, age acceleration in premenopausal women independently predicted breast cancer. Case-only analysis suggested that, among women who develop breast cancer, increased age acceleration is associated with invasive cancer (OR for invasive=1.09, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.22, P = 0.10).

&gt; **Conclusions**  
&gt; DNA methylation-based measures of biological age may be important predictors of breast cancer risk.

Press release: [Older biologic age linked to elevated breast cancer risk - NIH scientists use epigenetics to help predict disease development](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/nioe-oba022219.php)

&gt; Biologic age, a DNA-based estimate of a person's age, is associated with future development of breast cancer, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health. Biologic age was determined by measuring DNA methylation, a chemical modification to DNA that is part of the normal aging process. The study showed for every five years a woman's biologic age was older than her chronologic or actual age, known as age acceleration, she had a 15 percent increase in her chance of developing breast cancer. The study was published online Feb. 22 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

&gt; Scientists from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, speculate that biologic age may be tied to environmental exposures. If so, it may be a useful indicator of disease risk. They used three different measures, called epigenetic clocks, to estimate biologic age. These clocks measure methylation found at specific locations in DNA. Researchers use these clocks to estimate biologic age, which can then be compared to chronologic age.

&gt; The researchers used DNA from blood samples provided by women enrolled in the NIEHS-led Sister Study, a group of more than 50,000 women in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The study was specifically designed to identify environmental and genetic risk factors for breast cancer. The research team measured methylation in a subset of 2,764 women, all of whom were cancer-free at the time of blood collection.

&gt; ""We found that if your biologic age is older than your chronologic age, your breast cancer risk is increased. The converse was also true. If your biologic age is younger than your chronologic age, you may have decreased risk of developing breast cancer,"" said corresponding author Jack Taylor, M.D., Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology Group. ""However, we don't yet know how exposures and lifestyle factors may affect biologic age or whether this process can be reversed.""

&gt; Lead author Jacob Kresovich, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Taylor group, had read studies that used epigenetic clocks to predict age-related mortality. Since age is the leading risk factor for breast cancer, he hypothesized that age acceleration may be associated with higher breast cancer risk.

&gt; ""If you look at a group of people who are all the same age, some may be perfectly healthy while others are not,"" Kresovich said. ""That variability in health may be better captured by biologic age than chronologic age.""

&gt; Kresovich suggests that using DNA methylation to measure biologic age may help scientists better understand who is at risk for developing cancer and other age-related diseases. This research is an example of epigenetics, a field that studies how biochemical processes turn individual genes on or off, without affecting the DNA sequence.

&gt; The Taylor group plans to continue using epigenetic data, along with information on genetics, environment, and lifestyle to better understand how these factors interact and contribute to disease risks.",1,1550865731,longevity

David Alfego, PhD, Drexel University

Cellular aging describes the buildup of changes over time that affect normal mechanisms of cells, tissues and organisms throughout their lifespan, which can lead to any number of potential health risks, diseases or other disorders. One of the major causes of these changes is declining mitochondrial function, though the cause of this energy stress is still debated. The prevailing experimental model for aging studies examines cells in a senescent state as the hallmark of aging. Yet this permanent, post-mitotic phase is more commonly observed in vitro. Aged cells in vivo often retain their mitotic potential, indicative of a paused, quiescent state. This thesis proposes a new platform to study aging through perturbations of mitochondrial function via an experimental energy restriction in quiescence (ERiQ) model that may be more relevant to aging in tissues. This model causes adaptive changes in major stress response pathways for AKT, NF-jB, p53 and mTOR as a reaction to reduced ATP, NAD+ and NADP levels. The construction of a theoretical computational model, complementary to the experimental model, is based on feedback motifs that investigate the interplay between those key stress response pathways. The in silico model demonstrates adaptations to sudden energetic perturbations, promoting pro-survival phenotypes and recovery. This thesis hy- pothesizes that the very same survival mechanisms are chronically activated during aging, but also cause conflicting responses that actively suppress mitochondrial function to contribute to a lockstep progression of decline. The model makes predictions consistent with inhibitory and gain-of-function experiments in aging.
The relevance of ERiQ as a model to study aging is further emphasized by a transcription factor (TF) meta-analysis of gene expression datasets accrued from 18 tissues from individuals at different biological ages, which were compared to 7 different experimental platforms. Experimental datasets included replicative senescence and ERiQ, in which ATP was transiently reduced. TF motifs in promoter regions of trimmed sets of target genes were scanned using JASPAR and TRANSFAC motifs and TF signatures established a global mapping of agglomerating motifs with distinct clusters when ranked hierarchically. Remarkably, the majority of in vivo aged tissues correlated with the ERiQ profile instead of senescence, confirming its relevance as a new experimental model. Fitting motifs in a minimalistic protein-protein interaction (PPI) network model allowed us to probe for connectivity to distinct stress sensors, as well as identify novel targets of study in transcription factors that significantly switch enrichment between ERiQ and senescence. In the PPI, DNA damage sensors ATM and ATR linked to one subnetwork associated with senescence. By contrast, energy sensors PTEN and AMPK connected to the nodes in the ERiQ subnetwork. These data suggest that energy deprivation may be linked to transcriptional patterns characteristic of many aged tissues distinct from cumulative DNA damage associated with senescence. Finally, this thesis exemplifies the combined use of the predictive power of the computational model with experimental investigation in vitro. Preliminary experiments show how the model can be refined to reflect how certain conditions may alter metabolic output and offer intriguing insights into the future of cellular aging studies.

*Comment: The SENS platform is designed to repair or obviate all known forms of age-related damage—defined as permanent alterations that occur largely at random over the life span, and which ultimately accumulate to levels that compromise cellular and organ-level functions, leading to the pathologies of old age. Crucially, the great majority of the dysfunction observed in aged tissue is not of this permanent class; rather, it is the result of ongoing responses to the presence of hard damage—responses which in general are adaptive and protective in an acute context, but which become pathological when an inability to remove the noxious stimulus leads to their chronic activation. It is hoped that at least in some cases, such maladaptive cellular states will return automatically to homeostasis once the underlying damage is effectively resolved. This thesis lends support to that idea, showing that much of the pattern of bioenergetic failure observed in aged tissue is of an essentially reversible nature (ERiQ, unlike senescence, reverts to a healthy phenotype when normal energy levels are restored)—consistent with the seminal finding in 201311 that a decline in NAD+ underlies a large part of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction,12 but that this phenotype can be effectively treated simply by boosting NAD+ levels. Therapies based on that premise13 are being rapidly advanced toward the clinic and seem likely to be a boon to a large fraction of the populace, yet their benefit is likely to be rather limited in the long term since the hard damage responsible for declining NAD+ is not addressed (accordingly, preclinical data suggest that such therapies can greatly bolster health span, but not maximal life span; to some extent, the same benefits can be achieved through traditional means14 ). What, then, is the real nature of that damage? Recent work has pointed to the enzyme CD38 as the dominant NAD+ recycler in mammalian tissues, with an age-related increase in expression and activity that parallels the observed decline in NAD+ levels (and specific CD38 inhibitors are already being assessed for their ability to block that decline15 ). That increased expression, though, is driven by inflammatory signaling—the product (in the context of aging) of senescent cell accumulation, protein adducts such as AGEs,16 and so forth. The development of therapies that comprehensively resolve those forms of damage will ultimately prevent their deleterious downstream effects, without the inevitable side effects of intervening in dynamic metabolic processes.*",1,1550816717,longevity

&gt; Restoration of cognitive function in old mice by transfer of blood or plasma from young mice has been attributed to reduced C–C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) and β2-microglobulin, which are thought to suppress neurogenesis in the aging brain. However, the specific role of the hematopoietic system in this rejuvenation has not been defined and the importance of neurogenesis in old mice is unclear. Here we report that transplantation of young bone marrow to rejuvenate the hematopoietic system preserved cognitive function in old recipient mice, despite irradiation-induced suppression of neurogenesis, and without reducing β2-microglobulin. Instead, young bone marrow transplantation preserved synaptic connections and reduced microglial activation in the hippocampus. Circulating CCL11 levels were lower in young bone marrow recipients, and CCL11 administration in young mice had the opposite effect, reducing synapses and increasing microglial activation. In conclusion, young blood or bone marrow may represent a future therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disease.

Press release: [Young bone marrow rejuvenates aging mouse brains, study finds](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/cmc-ybm021919.php)

&gt; LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL 5:00 A.M. EST ON FEB. 20, 2019) -- A new study has found that transplanting the bone marrow of young laboratory mice into old mice prevented cognitive decline in the old mice, preserving their memory and learning abilities. The findings support an emerging model that attributes cognitive decline, in part, to aging of blood cells, which are produced in bone marrow.

&gt; ""While prior studies have shown that introducing blood from young mice can reverse cognitive decline in old mice, it is not well understood how this happens,"" said Helen Goodridge, PhD, associate professor of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study. ""Our research suggests one answer lies in specific properties of youthful blood cells.""

&gt; If further research confirms similar processes in people, the findings could provide a pathway for designing therapies to slow progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, that affect millions of Americans, Goodridge said.

&gt; In the study, published in the journal Communications Biology, 18-month-old laboratory mice received bone marrow transplants from either 4-month-old mice or mice their own age. Six months later, both transplanted groups underwent standard laboratory tests of activity level and learning, plus spatial and working memory. Mice that received young bone marrow outperformed mice that received old bone marrow. They also outperformed a control group of old mice that did not get transplants.

&gt; The research team then examined the hippocampus, a region associated with memory, in the mice brains. Recipients of young bone marrow retained more connections, known as synapses, between neurons in the hippocampus than did recipients of old bone marrow, even though they had about the same number of neurons. Synapses are critical to brain performance.

&gt; Further tests showed a possible reason for the missing synapses. The blood cells made by the young bone marrow reduced the activation of microglia, a type of immune cell in the brain. Microglia support neuron health but can become overactive and participate in disconnection of the synapses. With fewer overactive microglia, neurons would remain healthy and more synapses would survive.

&gt; ""We are entering an era in which there will be more elderly people in the population, along with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease, putting a huge burden on the health system,"" said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute, professor of Biomedical Sciences and Medicine and co-senior author of the new study. ""Our work indicates that cognitive decline in mice can be significantly reduced by simply providing young blood cells, which act on the brain to reduce the loss of synapses related to aging.""

&gt; Translating the findings, if confirmed in human samples, into potential treatments may be challenging, given that bone marrow transplants are not currently feasible for this use. But for future studies in people, Svendsen is working on creating ""personalized"" young blood stem cells for an individual through stem cell technology.

Ageing constitutes the most important risk factor for all major chronic ailments, including malignant, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, behavioural and pharmacological interventions with feasible potential to promote health upon ageing remain rare. Here we report the identification of the flavonoid 4,4′-dimethoxychalcone (DMC) as a natural compound with anti-ageing properties. External DMC administration extends the lifespan of yeast, worms and flies, decelerates senescence of human cell cultures, and protects mice from prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Concomitantly, DMC induces autophagy, which is essential for its cytoprotective effects from yeast to mice. This pro-autophagic response induces a conserved systemic change in metabolism, operates independently of TORC1 signalling and depends on specific GATA transcription factors. Notably, we identify DMC in the plant Angelica keiskei koidzumi, to which longevity- and health-promoting effects are ascribed in Asian traditional medicine. In summary, we have identified and mechanistically characterised the conserved longevity-promoting effects of a natural anti-ageing drug.",1,1550673396,longevity

&gt; Taking a young person’s plasma and infusing it into an older person to ward off aging -- a therapy that’s fascinated some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley -- has no proven clinical benefit, the Food and Drug Administration said.

&gt; The agency issued a safety alert on Tuesday about the infusion of plasma from young donors for the prevention of conditions such as aging or memory loss, or for the treatment of such conditions as dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease or post‐traumatic stress disorder.

&gt; “There is no proven clinical benefit of infusion of plasma from young donors to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent these conditions, and there are risks associated with the use of any plasma product,” the FDA said in a statement from Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Peter Marks, head of the agency’s biologics center.


&gt; The idea of infusing young blood to fight aging has attracted technology entrepreneurs like billionaire Peter Thiel and was lampooned in a 2017 episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.” Thiel’s reported interest was sparked by a company called Ambrosia, which has locations in five states across the U.S. and sells one liter of blood plasma from donors between the ages of 16 and 25 for $8,000, according to its website.

&gt; Ambrosia’s website was updated Tuesday to say it has “ceased patient treatments” in compliance with the FDA’s advisory.

&gt; Gottlieb and Marks said none of the plasma treatments has gone through the rigorous testing required by the agency. Ambrosia says “experiments in mice called parabiosis provided the inspiration to deliver treatments with young plasma.” The FDA approval typically requires human trials before companies can make a specific health claim about a product.

&gt; Plasma, the liquid portion of blood, contains proteins to help the blood clot. Plasma infusion is an approved use by the FDA in trauma settings or in patients whose blood doesn’t coagulate. But, the FDA says, there are risks, including allergic reactions, circulatory overload, lung injury and infectious disease transmission.

&gt; EH301 is a combination of pterostilbene (PT)—an analog of resveratrol found in blueberries—and nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor to the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). In addition to its pivotal role in the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that fuels cells, NAD+ drives the activity of sirtuins. The human genome encodes seven sirtuins. They carry out multiple functions, including deacetylation of transcription factors, histones, and other targets, and are involved in processes known to go awry during aging and in neurodegenerative disease, including energy metabolism, inflammation, and DNA repair.

&gt; The data shown here seems extraordinary in that the active group seemed to actually “improve” over the four-month trial period. If true, fantastic! But it reminds me a bit of the Italian trial of lithium—amazing results in a small cohort and completely negative results in a true placebo-controlled trial.

&gt; Also, this is not a new target, and it is surprising that this company has come up with a magic bullet. Elysium Health is a bit of a controversial company, selling anti-aging pills, which I believe are at least related to EH301, over the internet. Maybe it’s all true, and I really hope it is, but I would like to see a larger multicenter trial done by another, independent group.

&gt; It is very remarkable and encouraging to see that the investigators report a clinical improvement in the ALS patients and not just a slowing of progression of this devastating disease. Findings like these urgently require independent confirmation.  

&gt; One has to keep in mind that this is a very small cohort at a single center, and such a trial design is very vulnerable to statistical outliers and other biases. Therefore an independent confirmation with a more robust study design that includes more patients, multiple centers, and ideally objective biomarkers such as neurofilaments and possibly a dose response is required before firm conclusions on the efficacy of this promising approach can be drawn.

&amp; nbsp;

&gt; Merit Cudkowicz, Massachusetts General Hospital, HMS

&gt; I do think the data support proceeding to another study. I also encourage the company and investigators to develop biomarkers to measure the biological effects of treatment.  

&gt; It is, of course, exciting to see positive results in an ALS trial. The caveats—which are important—include that the study was very small, duration of follow-up short in the double-blind period, and that about one-third of people stopped treatment early. I couldn’t tell from paper how drop-outs were handled in the analysis.

&gt; Because ALS is such a heterogenous disorder, results from small studies can sometimes not bear out when a larger confirmatory study is done (e.g., lithium and dexpramipexole studies). The data here is encouraging but not definitive. It would be important to move forward expeditiously, though, for a confirmatory trial in larger group of participants and for longer duration.

&gt; Richard Bedlack, Duke University

&gt; This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of EH301 (which elevates NAD+ and activates sirtuins) in patients with ALS. The authors concluded that that the drug was safe and associated with significant improvements, not just slowing of decline, in several important outcome measures including ALSFRS-R, MRC manual muscle testing, and forced vital capacity. Placebo-treated patients declined on all these measures at a rate consistent with that seen in other published trials. The authors call for a larger Phase 2 trial of EH301.  

&gt; There are several problems with interpreting the results of this study. First, the sample size was quite small (only 15 patients assigned to drug and 17 assigned to placebo). Following randomization, the two groups were unfortunately not well-balanced in disease duration and starting ALSFRS-R or starting MRC, meaning it is not clear how comparable they were even before they received any treatment. The duration of follow-up in the randomized trial was short (four months). In spite of this short duration, there were a surprising number of patients who did not complete the study in each group (5/15 in the drug-treated and 7/17 in the placebo-treated group).  We are told that none of the dropouts (or adverse events) were related to treatment, but no explanations were given for the “hepatitis” or “profound mental depression” that caused two drop-outs in the EH301 group. It does not appear that the data in this study were analyzed via “intention to treat.” By analyzing only those patients remaining in the study at each time point, biases may have been created. Finally, three of the authors of this study received salary support and stock options from Elysium Health, the company that owns EH301. This creates a potential for bias and conflict of interest.In spite of these problems I agree that these results warrant a follow-up trial. I hope that this new trial will have a larger sample size, longer duration, be clearer about the causes of adverse events, and utilize intention to treat analyses. It would also be nice if the follow-up study measured NAD+ or sirtuin activation and utilized different dosages of EH301 so we could see whether there is any dose-response curve on any of the clinical outcomes or biomarkers.  

&gt; One final question many patients will have is how EH301 compares to the over-the-counter supplement called Basis currently being sold by Elysium Health, which ALSUntangled reviewed in 2017. Hopefully Elysium Health will shed some light on this in the near future so patients can make an informed decision on whether they now want to try Basis for their ALS.

&gt; This pilot study, although small, is very exciting. The fact that many of the patients taking the drug did not show decline in several clinical endpoints measured in the study is promising. The preclinical data available in cell culture models suggest that the two components of EH301 have the potential to engage multiple mechanisms that could be neuroprotective in the context of ALS pathology. Overall, this seems to be a promising, and reasonably safe, therapeutic approach for ALS treatment. Further confirmation in a bigger cohort will be necessary in order to establish its effectiveness to slow disease progression in patients with ALS.",1,1550525670,longevity

,shrillthrill,"&gt;  Does this mean that high fat in humans might not actually make us fat? And that the longevity result in the mice study might not apply to humans?

A diet that overweight people happen to stick to (to control energy intake) need not be the diet best for longevity.    The first paper talks about the long run, and the second where you have quoted talks about the short run.

The mouse study looks at mTOR activation as a mediator for lifespan (long run).   I kind of feel like the review paper is focused on lifestyle issues that present more of a concern prior to any benefit of lessening activation of mTOR, so are not really overlapping conceptually (short run).

&gt; This last bit is completely contrary to low carb high fat / keto diet. Does this result actually hold for humans, as opposed to mice? And if it doesn't hold for humans, why do we think that the longevity result would hold for humans?

I don't know what the mouse study has to indicate about keto, since keto doesn't necessarily need to be high protein.  Speculatively, in humans low/adequate protein and high fat keto would certainly be less palatable and maybe have lower adherence.  I think it does suggest that high protein (keto or not?) looks worse.

&gt; The two studies seem to contradict each other on adiposity. 

Taking the best of ad libitum feeding in mice as a comparison point for a limited selection of studies on human diets seems a bit off to me.  By making this comparison, should human diets be ad libitum on macro nutrients that lead to less adiposity or is some temperance on protein required for other benefits (mTOR↓ and hepatic FGF21↑ as two select examples)?  TRF/IF can even play into adherence and energy intake. Even culture plays some role in diet.
 For these reasons I think the base of evidence being drawn on is too small, for such a broad question around lifestyle disease, lifespan being boiled down to macronutrient ratios.  

While it is important to not have excess body fat, there might be factors to consider in the long run after surviving complications.   The review article linked only looks at fat macros between 25-35% which is relatively high compared to what can be achieved by eliminating processed foods like oil (maybe somewhere in the 8-15% range reduces overall energy density), which could see further reductions in LDL-C, and maybe it would be easier to adhere to and result in greater weight loss (?? more a question for those studying obesity rather than aging).   

There are so many ways you can dice and slice weight loss studies, and there are different strategies that work for different people, it feels a bit tangential on this subreddit maybe a better topic for /r/ScientificNutrition where diet studies are one of the primary focuses.

That aside, I suspect we would be better off trying to evaluate the results of diets using biomarkers for aging like epigenetic clocks, e.g.  GrimAge.  or NAD+, and whether there is any relationship between NAD+ levels and epigenetic age.

There is preliminary evidence that eating a high protein diet may reduce NAD+ levels: [High protein intake is associated with low plasma NAD+ levels in a healthy human cohort (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114226)

...growing popularity and validation for the epigenetic clock measurements might actually see them used more, so we don't just have to look at temporary improvements in lipids and adiposity to draw conclusions about the influence of diet on aging.   Maybe it will be somewhat inconsequential when not ad libitum.

a) fail to deal with accelerated damage from being overweight/obesity?  
b) fail deal with higher levels of mTOR activation, and less NAD+ over the lifespan from some people eating higher protein?

[Wikipedia entry on Fisetin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisetin)

&gt; Fisetin (7,3′,4′-flavon-3-ol), is a plant polyphenol from the flavonoid group. It can be found in many plants, where it serves as a colouring agent. It is also found in many fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, apples, persimmons, onions and cucumbers.

Recent evidence in mice modeling a progeroid syndrome, and aged wild-type mice has emerged for Fisetin playing a senolytic role.   The amount used in the following study, scaled to humans would be:  100mg/kg * 70kg = 7000mg 7000mg / 12.3 for human dose conversion ~570 mg for a 70kg person.   

* [Fisetin is a senotherapeutic that extends health and lifespan (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279143).

What effect will this have on human healthspan and longevity?  Unknown until we have better research.

&gt; The IARC and WHO designate airborne particulates a Group 1 carcinogen.^[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24911630) Particulates are the deadliest form of air pollution[citation needed] due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, respiratory disease, and premature death.^[8] In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%. The smaller PM2.5 were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3 as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs.^[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23849838) Worldwide exposure to PM2.5 contributed to 4.1 million deaths from heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections in 2016. ^[10](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga-2018-report.pdf) Overall, ambient particulate matter ranks as the sixth leading risk factor for premature death globally.^[11](https://undark.org/breathtaking)

&gt; The Academy embraces a 4C MISSION: First to catalyze the world’s ongoing research to accelerate the development of life-changing enhancements of healthy aging. Second to connect our founders to each other through the auspices of the academy. The third C: Convene experts and authorities around the world to advance their missions and that of the Academy’s in public and private settings. Finally, we shall communicate with the public at large to educate them about this new generation of health span and longevity research, what it means and what it doesn’t mean, and to engage in constructive conversations.

&gt; “As founders of AHLR, we believe that, as the field rapidly advances, we must help bridge the gap between science and public understanding,” said founding member Judith Campisi, PhD, Buck Institute. “We believe that while death is inevitable, aging need not be.” This is important at the personal level and for our culture. Health care costs are coupled with the economic impact of society’s loss of productivity from years of declining vigor.  We want to play the seminal role of bringing health span and longevity breakthroughs and their social implications to the attention of the public and governments throughout the world.” 

&gt; Start-up funding for the non-profit, a 501-C3 organization, has come from companies, family trusts and individuals excited by the potential and social implications of health and lifespan expansion. The Academy’s initial founders (full list and affiliations attached) will be augmented by a growing roster of global longevity researchers as new members join.  

&gt; The first Academy conference takes place July 30 and 31 in Paris, convening to share results of new studies, recently published papers and areas of common inquiry.

,SirT6,"Maybe a bit artsy, but here is how I usually pitch retrotransposons as an under-appreciated source of aging and disease:

&gt; A war has been raging between mammalian genomes and retrotransposons for over 100 million years.

&gt; These insidious parasites use host replication machinery to 'copy and paste' themselves across the genome. And they have been enormously successful. Mammalian genomes are riddled with the scars of these 'copy and paste' events. Indeed, nearly half of the DNA content of the human genome is derived from retotransposons.

&gt; The reason retrotransposons are dangerous (in the context of human health) is that whenever they 'copy and paste' themselves, they create potentially mutagenic insertions. Depending on which genes are mutated, it is possible that a retrotransposition event can predispose a cell to cancerous transformation -- in fact, a hallmark of cancer genomes is increased copy number and heightened activity of these retrotransposons. Another interesting observation that researchers have made is that L1 retrotransposons (the focus of this study, and the most active of the mammalian retrotransposons) have a tendency to disrupt genes which regulate basic neurological function when they 'copy and paste' themselves in the brain. People have speculated that this may lead contribute to certain neurodegenerative disorders.

&gt; New York (Feb. 7, 2019)—Medical care for older adults has long focused on preventing and treating chronic diseases and the conditions that come with them. But now, geriatrics researchers and clinicians hope a new understanding—one honed at a prestigious conference hosted by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA), with support from The John A. Hartford Foundation—can lead to better and more effective interventions by targeting the aging process itself rather than discrete conditions or concerns.

&gt; “Aging is complex and varies from one person to the next, but there’s a growing body of evidence that aging itself is driven by interconnected biological factors we call ‘hallmarks’ or ‘pillars,’” said Christopher Carpenter, MD, MSc, FACEP, FAAEM, AGSF, one of the co-authors of a report on the conference. “We believe disrupting these hallmarks—which cover everything from the stability of our genes to ways our cells communicate—can contribute to chronic disease and frailty, which is why a better understanding of how they work is so important.”

&gt; Rather than beginning with the discrete health conditions and concerns common among older adults, conference organizers took the unique approach of focusing on aging itself as a primary factor impacting multiple chronic diseases and the declining ability to rebound from health challenges (also known as “resilience”). In doing so, GEMSSTAR scholars advanced our understanding of the concept that targeting age-related mechanisms might delay, prevent, or even reverse geriatric syndromes, age-related chronic diseases, and declines in resilience. Conference sessions also focused on new methods and strategies for studying these aspects of aging, and reviewed the challenges of studying age when older people often have been excluded from medical research.",1,1549878823,longevity

Profile on Leafscience.org: https://www.leafscience.org/dr-michael-lustgarten-using-an-evidence-based-approach-for-optimal-health-and-longevity/

In the video he goes over some of his educational background, experience with researching associations between gut bacteria and health.   Currently the field is immature and we don't know, maybe in the future there will be individual recommendations for ways to alter the microbiome for better health - currently there is a gap.  He thinks a high fibre diet (&gt;65g of fibre) is likely beneficial for improving gut barrier function and keeping things out of the blood that should only be in the gut.


He says he does regular blood testing while making changes to his diet to self experiment around biomarkers of aging, based on CBC blood panel which costs him $30 a pop.   He inputs the results of this standard blood test into the [aging.ai](http://aging.ai) website,  a deep-learned predictor of your age made with a deep neural network trained on hundreds of thousands anonymized human blood tests, built by [insilico medicine](https://www.leafscience.org/a-i-versus-aging/).

https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/

&gt; In the process of exploring how the liver’s daily cycles work, Panda found that mice which eat within a set amount of time (8-12 hours) resulted in slimmer, healthier mice than those who ate the same number of calories in a larger window of time, showing that when one eats may be as important as what one eats. If the benefits of this “time-restricted eating“ (TRE) hold true in humans, it could have profound impacts on treating overeating disorders, diabetes and obesity.

&gt; The circadian clock, he found, even mediates the immune system. Mice with a crucial circadian molecule missing had higher levels of inflammation in their bodies than other mice, suggesting that genes and molecules involved in the circadian clock could be drug targets for conditions linked to inflammation, such as infections or cancer.



&gt; Panda’s lab discovered that confining caloric consumption to an 8- to 12-hour period–as people did just a century ago– might stave off high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. He is exploring whether the benefits of time-restricted eating apply to humans as well as mice.

Rhonda Patrick did two interviews with Satchin on the topic:

* [Dr. Satchin Panda on Practical Implementation of Time-Restricted Eating &amp; Shift Work Strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iywhaz5z0qs&amp;vl=en)

Some papers on the topic:

* [Time restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake prevents metabolic diseases in mice fed a high fat diet (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/22608008/)  
* [Effects of eight weeks of time-restricted feeding (16/8) on basal metabolism, maximal strength, body composition, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk factors in resistance-trained males (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27737674/)

&gt; Thirty-four resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to time-restricted feeding (TRF) or normal diet group (ND). TRF subjects consumed 100 % of their energy needs in an 8-h period of time each day, with their caloric intake divided into three meals consumed at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m. The remaining 16 h per 24-h period made up the fasting period. Subjects in the ND group consumed 100 % of their energy needs divided into three meals consumed at 8 a.m., 1 p.m., and 8 p.m

&gt; Our results suggest that an intermittent fasting program in which all calories are consumed in an 8-h window each day, in conjunction with resistance training, could improve some health-related biomarkers, decrease fat mass, and maintain muscle mass in resistance-trained males.

My summary: Aging, can be defined as a deterioration of the cell functioning due to damage accumulation over time. It can be presumed that induction or restoration of autophagy and antioxidant cellular systems could alleviate aging symptoms. Rapamycin, resveratrol, polyamines, and Caloric Restriction are possible candidates to be tested more carefully in order to improve the putative treatments for human age-related diseases.

Failure of the autophagic process has been reported to worsen aging-associated diseases, such as neurodegeneration or cancer, among others. ... \[extending\] lifespan, although the molecular mechanisms behind it and the connection with aging are not yet clear

The result of smoothly running autophagy is a cell that is less cluttered with damaged parts and waste, and thus a cell that causes fewer issues to the tissue it is a part of. Many of the methods shown to slow aging in laboratory species such as flies, nematodes, and mice involve increased autophagy. “hormesis,” according to which low doses of a stressor can improve the cell response for a more detrimental condition in the future.

&gt; The age of tissues and cells can be accurately estimated by DNA methylation analysis. The multitissue DNA methylation (DNAm) age predictor combines the DNAm levels of 353 CpG dinucleotides to arrive at an age estimate referred to as DNAm age.  
&gt; Recent studies based on short‐term observations showed that the DNAm age of reconstituted blood following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) reflects the age of the donor.   
&gt; However, it is not known whether the DNAm age of donor blood remains independent of the recipient's age over the long term. Importantly, long‐term studies including child recipients have the potential to clearly reveal whether DNAm age is cell‐intrinsic or whether it is modulated by extracellular cues in vivo.  
&gt; Here, we address this question by analyzing blood methylation data from HSCT donor and recipient pairs who greatly differed in chronological age (age differences between 1 and 49 years). We found that the DNAm age of the reconstituted blood was not influenced by the recipient's age, even 17 years after HSCT, in individuals without relapse of their hematologic disorder. However, the DNAm age of recipients with relapse of leukemia was unstable. These data are consistent with our previous findings concerning the abnormal DNAm age of cancer cells, and it can potentially be exploited to monitor the health of HSCT recipients.

David Sinclair does work in the field of aging research, and appearing in the media is part of the job of science communication.  If people end up here slightly confused or over-optimistic, we should be at least informative and not misleading, even if we think the original presentation left some things to be desired.

,krist-all,If you have good gut health and can absorb nutrients well I see no problem in supplementing to be honest. Might even be better than injecting nutrients since it is the natural way. People eating a western diet can absolutly benefit from the injection I belive. Since their gut microbiome is probably unbalanced and leaky. Which in turn makes absorbstion of most nutrients a lot harder.,1,1549272015,longevity
,shrillthrill,"This is actually partly answered by the FAQ, but I'll summarise here with a specific reply:

At this point the evidence is unclear for healthy people.  If you are diabetic or have elevated blood sugar, you can talk to a doctor.  

David Sinclair closely monitors his bloodwork using a paid tracking service called insidetracker.... so if he were at risk of b12, he'd know about it.   Taking a B12 supplement and getting regular blood tests would be wise for anyone self-experimenting.

&gt; Others have said it's not worth taking unless you're older and that there are better over the counter alternatives (berberine).

This is a common misconception.  Berberine is only studied for effects on blood sugar, not on longevity like metformin is.  People do recommend berberine as an alternative for blood sugar management.   

Based on research in animals and in-vitro, the thought is that [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) can extend healthspan, and maybe lifespan.  See the [TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) clinical trial FAQ for more details on the proposed study.](https://www.afar.org/natgeo/).   

Others argue that the benefit may be marginal (which is [suggested by the NIA funded ITP1](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Met/C2011) (click to view the survival details),  but the real benefit is if it bolsters support for aging to be recognised as a disease target from a regulatory point of view.  

A lot of interest around metformin in humans came from this paper: [Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without? A comparison of mortality in people initiated with metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy and matched, non-diabetic controls (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041462) 

This paper has met criticism around whether there were differences in the groups that led to the outcomes unrelated to metformin:

* https://pubpeer.com/publications/4E29C6C9E32D2C24662AED78A59AC5


Open questions: Is metformin a type of exercise mimetic?  How much of metformin's benefit could be achieved by lifestyle interventions such as exercise?  Both metformin and exercise overlap in activating the [Nrf2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770706) and [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase#Exercise/training) cellular pathways.

This is not a complete dismissal of metformin, as mechanisms may exist for improving health, but they have yet to be clearly elucidated to the point of being a strong evidence based recommendation.  It is more a reminder to know about the grade of evidence available to date.  The TAME trial may be able to reveal more fine grained effects in humans if sufficient biomarkers exist and are chosen for detecting differences in age related pathology.   See next paper:

The most recent update on the proposed TAME trial can be found here: [A framework for selection of blood-based biomarkers for geroscience-guided clinical trials: report from the TAME Biomarkers Workgroup (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151729).

If interesting in funding the TAME trial and metformin research specifically, it may be best to contact them before donating to make sure it goes to the intended project.


As for David, maybe he is involved in unpublished research that supports data he has seen on metformin, and has decided that given his age (49) and lack of side effects, he's willing to bet/speculate on benefit.

As for a much bigger problem, I can from your history tell that you are overweight. Tearing ligaments in your foot does not happen to normal-weight people. That is the major focus if you want to live longer. The first step to combating your weight issues is to cut out **ALL** sugars from your diet. That includes fruit, and the 20% sugar that is in prepared sauces, crackers, flavored yoghurt. Some think it helps to cut sweeteners as well, as they drive your desire to have sugar.

As for fat, the evidence is in that sugar is infinately more obesogenic than fat, and the evidence that fat is bad for your health is pretty shoddy. So if you end up replacing sugar with fat, honestly, that's fine.",1,1549187999,longevity
,shrillthrill,"&gt; That would give a conservative dosing that approximates the 100 mg/kg/day dose in mice.

Yep.

&gt; What would be the equivalent dose for NR?

Depends what you mean by equivalent.  Technically there is no equivalence because NR hasn't been studied head to head with NMN... and this is where the scientists who have put their name behind NR/Elysium Basis have received criticism for being something like misleading:

While both do raise NAD+, because they are different precursors and the two could be different in their effects just because of where they sit in the metabolic chain, so over the course of the long term there could be divergence in effects or different effects in different organs, despite seeing that NAD+ is increased with NR in a short term study. 

For example, between these two studies NR was not useful and NMN was useful in a mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia cardiomyopathy.

[Nicotinamide mononucleotide requires SIRT3 to improve cardiac function and bioenergetics in a Friedreich’s ataxia cardiomyopathy model (2017)](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/93885)

Until there's a study that replicates ""Long-Term Administration of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Mitigates Age-Associated Physiological Decline in Mice (2016)"" but with NR (or whatever is next) - we can only speculate that it might achieve a similar effect, but as with any different molecule one has to wait and see how it performs.

Only further studies on NR that show outcomes rather than just an increase in NAD+ can provide support for taking NR.

Unless you are taking NR for a specific health condition and can measure improvement comparing the two personally, I think it's impossible to start equivocating.",1,1549167088,longevity

* [Dietary glycine supplementation mimics lifespan extension by dietary methionine restriction in Fisher 344 rats (2011)](https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.528.2)  

&gt; Dietary methionine (Met) restriction (MR) extends lifespan in rodents by 30–40% and inhibits growth. Since glycine is the vehicle for hepatic clearance of excess Met via glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), we hypothesized that dietary glycine supplementation (GS) might produce biochemical and endocrine changes similar to MR and also extend lifespan.  
&gt; Seven-week-old male Fisher 344 rats were fed diets containing 0.43% Met/2.3% glycine (control fed; CF) or 0.43% Met/4%, 8% or 12% glycine until natural death. In 8% or 12% GS rats, median lifespan increased from 88 weeks (w) to 113 w, and maximum lifespan increased from 91 w to 119 w v CF. Body growth reduction was less dramatic, and not even significant in the 8% GS group. Dose-dependent reductions in several serum markers were also observed. Long-term (50 w) 12% GS resulted in reductions in mean (±SD) fasting glucose (158 ± 13 v 179 ± 46 mg/dL), insulin (0.7 ± 0.4 v 0.8 ± 0.3 ng/mL), IGF-1 (1082 ± 128 v 1407 ± 142 ng/mL) and triglyceride (113 ± 31 v 221 ± 56 mg/dL) levels compared to CF. Adiponectin, which increases with MR, did not change in GS after 12 w on diet.  
&gt; We propose that more efficient Met clearance via GNMT with GS could be reducing chronic Met toxicity due to rogue methylations from chronic excess methylation capacity or oxidative stress from generation of toxic by-products such as formaldehyde. This project received no outside funding.

* [Dietary Glycine Supplementation Extends Lifespan of Genetically Heterogeneous Mice (2018)](https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.533.112)

&gt; Preliminary experiments suggested lifespan extension by glycine supplementation (GlyS) without the growth inhibition seen with methionine restriction in Fisher 344 rats. This suggested that the benefit GlyS, rather than owing to increased methionine clearance (as was originally envisioned), was attributable to increased levels of glycine itself, acting via the glycine receptor.  
&gt; The glycine receptor is a glycine-gated chloride channel that is widespread among cell types, including macrophages, and GlyS has been shown by others to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties in several rodent models, and even to reverse Type 2 diabetes in a human trial. GlyS has also recently been found by others to restore the youthful mitochondrial phenotype in senescent cultured human fibroblasts, whose senescence was linked to epigenetic down-regulation of the principal pathways of endogenous glycine synthesis.  
&gt; The present study set out to replicate the life extension previously observed in rats, in large, reproducible populations of UM-HET-3, 4-way cross mice, in a Phase I Interventions Testing Program (ITP) trial of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Beginning at 9 months of age, GlyS mice were fed a diet containing 8% glycine (dry weight, compared to the level of 2.3% in the control diet) simultaneously at 3 sites (The Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; U.T. Health San Antonio, TX), employing approximately 50 each of male and female GlyS and 100 each of male and female controls at each site. Data were compiled after 90% of control mice had died at all 3 sites. 

&gt; Pooling data from all 3 sites (shown in Figure below), median lifespan was increased among GlyS mice by 3.7% among females and 1.3% among males, and the 90th percentile lifespan was increased by 1.8% among females and 3.6% among males (p = 0.00004 by log-rank test and p = 0.002 by Wang-Allison test for pooled males and females at all 3 sites combined). The observed lifespan extension is statistically robust, in that significant log-rank p-values were seen for each sex (pooling across site) and for each site (pooling across sexes). The Stage I ITP protocol measures only lifespan, and it is anticipated that Stage II trials will provide the opportunity for biochemical and other cross-sectional measures to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in the life extension observed in our system.

,shrillthrill,"&gt; I’m now finding these harder to get and also seeing many new supplements being offered (NMN, NAD+, NADH) that seem to do the same thing. What are the differences between these molecules? 

NMN and NR are NAD+ precursors, since it's NAD+ that has been shown to decline with age, and restoring it in animals improved their health.

NAD+ is not a supplement itself, or if people are selling it, it isn't thought to work orally.

&gt; What are the differences between these molecules?

The difference comes down to what research has been conducted and published on each compound, and the clinical trials that are either underway or planned that use either, and whether those succeed or fail.

NMN is thought to be a better NAD+ precursor, and it's not encumbered by a patent like NR.


NADH is an unrelated supplement, and not a NAD+ precursor so not really related to the former two or healthspan/longevity, since it hasn't been studied in that capacity.  As far as I can tell, it's mainly marketed for chronic fatigue based on this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20447621

&gt; I’ve been taking Nicotinamide riboside and PQQ for a few years now and have seen great benefits. 

How old are you and have you been able to quantify those benefits with measurements?  The reason I ask, is due to the scarcity of research on NR.   Fightaging.org has a blog post on how one might take measurements with self-experimentation that mentions niagen:

What they're working on has nothing to do with any of that.


Everyone already knows to exercise. Everyone already knows not to eat ""garbage"" food. Past that, it's been stated, restated, and restated again that diet, exercise, and supplementation (at least with today's supplements) together have a very small impact on aging. Even in terms of lifespan, optimizing those three things will only get you a few more years, at best.


The cumulative damage that Dr. Sinclair and his colleagues are working on repairing will inevitably overwhelm the human body, regardless of how healthy they are in terms of those lifestyle factors.


David Sinclair and his colleagues are working on ways to turn an unhealthy, out of shape 80-year-old into a biologically 20-year-old over the course of a few visits to the doctor. So he should speak more about that:

Resveratrol has failed to extend lifespan in mammals:

* [Future directions of resveratrol research (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29951589)

&gt; RSV appears to have better pro-longevity effects in some organisms compared to others as evidenced by the fact that this polyphenol is most effective for extending longevity in yeast, worms, and killifish while mice and flies are not as responsive to treatment [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27781945), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622429/)]. Although there is evidence to suggest that RSV supplementation is beneficial to improve markers of cardiometabolic health in rodents and non-human primates, the translational potential of RSV has been controversial. 

Metformin:

Metformin barely has an influence on [mouse lifespan](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Met/C2011), and human research on whether it has an effect on aging hasn't been completed, i.e. the TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin): https://www.afar.org/natgeo/.

One paper that might be pertinent in evaluating this: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-011-9224-6

&gt;   Much of the literature describing the search for agents that increase the life span of rodents was found to suffer from confounds. One-hundred-six studies, absent 20 contradictory melatonin studies, of compounds or combinations of compounds were reviewed. Only six studies reported both life span extension and food consumption data, thereby excluding the potential effects of caloric restriction. 

&gt; Six other studies reported life span extension without a change in body weight. However, weight can be an unreliable surrogate measure of caloric consumption. Twenty studies reported that food consumption or weight was unchanged, but it was unclear whether these data were anecdotal or systematic. Twenty-nine reported extended life span likely due to induced caloric restriction. Thirty-six studies reported no effect on life span, and three a decrease. The remaining studies suffer from more serious confounds. 

&gt; Though still widely cited, studies showing life span extension using short-lived or “enfeebled” rodents have not been shown to predict longevity effects in long-lived animals. We suggest improvements in experimental design that will enhance the reliability of the rodent life span literature. First, animals should receive measured quantities of food and its consumption monitored, preferably daily, and reported. Weights should be measured regularly and reported. Second, a genetically heterogeneous, long-lived rodent should be utilized. Third, chemically defined diets should be used. Fourth, a positive control (e.g., a calorically restricted group) is highly desirable. Fifth, drug dosages should be chosen based on surrogate endpoints or accepted cross-species scaling factors. These procedures should improve the reliability of the scientific literature and accelerate the identification of longevity and health span-enhancing agents.",3,1548796846,longevity

&gt; Ogimi village is renowned for its aging population. We sought to determine if the l-serine content of their diet could account for their neurological health.

&gt; RECENT FINDINGS:  
&gt; The most frequently consumed food items, including tofu and seaweeds, are rich in the dietary amino acid l-serine. l-serine content of the Ogimi diet &gt;8 grams/day for Ogimi women significantly exceeds the average American dietary intake of 2.5 grams/day for women &gt;70 years old.  

&gt; SUMMARY:  
&gt; Our hypothesis that the high l-serine content of the Ogimi diet is related to the paucity of tangle diseases among villagers is buttressed by in vivo results with non-human primates where dietary l-serine slowed development of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid plaques by up to 85% and a human clinical trial finding that l-serine at 15 grams/day twice daily slows functional decline in ALS patients.

""We coin this DNAm-based biomarker of mortality ""DNAm GrimAge"" because high values are grim news, with regards to mortality/morbidity risk.""
That is actually pretty funny.

This is a long paper and I need to read the details more closely but I'll try to summarize this as best I can.

DNA methylation is a covalent modification (an extra -CH3 group, or carbon and three hydrogens) attatched to the Cytosine nucleotide in DNA. These modifications change through out our life time, and while they do not impact the coding sequences of genes (ie. the order of A/T/C/G), they do affect our cell's ability to read and transcribe certain regions of DNA. It is one of the ways cells naturally control gene expression, during development and in maintaining homeostasis.

As we age, there are certain Cytosine bases in our genome that become methylated. Hovarth (the senior author of this paper) has demonstrated previously that if he measures the amount of methylated cytosines at these specific sites in the genome, he can accurately determine the age of the cell, which is really a remarkable protocol.

So GrimAge is a new way of analyzing this information and is taking it a step further, and now saying that they are able to predict the lifespan and quality of health of an individual based on the methylation levels in the DNA. For example. a 20 year old who does not smoke would most likely have lower levels of DNA methylation than a 20 year old who does smoke. They argue that by quantitating the level of DNA methylation on these specific locations in the genome, they can predict the age of cardivascular disase on-set. Pretty cool.

**Review of 10 years of the clinical use of brain natriuretic peptide in cardiology**

&gt;Ten years ago brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), the second compound of a family
of polypeptide hormones named natriuretic peptides was identified. This peptide
has great pathophysiologic importance as a stress-induced cardiac hormone
secreted from ventricles, and it rises in several cardiac diseases. It promotes natri-
uresis and diuresis, acts as a vasodilator, and antagonizes the vasoconstrictor
effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The measurement of this
peptide in blood by immunoassay has shown promise over the past decade in
clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Because heart failure is a major health prob-
lem worldwide, BNP is proposed as a biochemical marker that might provide a
useful screening test to select patients for further cardiac investigations. Such a
hormone assay is inexpensive and available. The implications of BNP in diagno-
sis, prognosis, and therapy will be reviewed. (J Lab Clin Med 1999; 134:437-44)

&gt;CONCLUSION

Ten years ago BNP was i d e n t i f i e d , and d u r i n g this
past d e c a d e it has b e e n e x t e n s i v e l y studied in v a r i o u s
clinical cardiologic diseases. This cardiac h o r m o n e pro-

,ronnyhugo,"&gt;So reducing stress can mean ditching the car and moving to a walkable or bikable city. 

City air in many cities across the globe is less safe than smoking cigarettes. 

The city pollution ranking should really use ""how many cigarettes would I have to smoke to be equivalent to being in this city air for one hour?"". The metric of just ranking the cities relative to each other, means you don't know if the 24th worst polluted city is equivalent to one cigarette or a hundred cigarettes. 

&gt; moving out of the city can also add stress to the equation since at that point you're having to drive, you're lonely in the suburbs and dealing with traffic and increasing the odds of dying in other ways. 

Ideally you have a job outside the city as well. Otherwise you're going to drive into an area every morning, an area which can effectively be treated as radioactive wasteland, because some day of the year in large cities, are more dangerous for health than driving by the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl. 

PS: The number one reason highways are dangerous in the US is because no one has lane discipline, so the left lane is never free for overtaking. In other nations its illegal to overtake in the right lanes. This and a few other things (16 year old drivers is madness) make road safety incredibly bad in the US. But that's only in the US.

Previous analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host health and disease status, genotype and diet. Here, we developed a method of predicting the biological age of the host based on the microbiological profiles of gut microbiota using a curated dataset of 1,165 healthy individuals (1,663 microbiome samples). Our predictive model, a human microbiome clock, has an architecture of a deep neural network and achieves the accuracy of 3.94 years mean absolute error in cross-validation. The performance of the deep microbiome clock was also evaluated on several additional populations. We further introduce a platform for biological interpretation of individual microbial features used in age models, which relies on permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects. This approach has allowed us to define two lists of 95 intestinal biomarkers of human aging. We further show that this list can be reduced to 39 taxa that convey the most information on their host's aging. Overall, we show that (a) microbiological profiles can be used to predict human age; and (b) microbial features selected by models are age-related.

Abstract: 

&gt; **Background**  
&gt; Cellular senescence is a key mechanism that drives age-related diseases, but has yet to be targeted therapeutically in humans. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal cellular senescence-associated disease. Selectively ablating senescent cells using dasatinib plus quercetin (DQ) alleviates IPF-related dysfunction in bleomycin-administered mice.

&gt; **Methods**  
&gt; A two-center, open-label study of intermittent DQ (D:100 mg/day, Q:1250 mg/day, three-days/week over three-weeks) was conducted in participants with IPF (n = 14) to evaluate feasibility of implementing a senolytic intervention. The primary endpoints were retention rates and completion rates for planned clinical assessments. Secondary endpoints were safety and change in functional and reported health measures. Associations with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were explored.

&gt; **Findings**  
&gt; Fourteen patients with stable IPF were recruited. The retention rate was 100% with no DQ discontinuation; planned clinical assessments were complete in 13/14 participants. One serious adverse event was reported. Non-serious events were primarily mild-moderate, with respiratory symptoms (n = 16 total events), skin irritation/bruising (n = 14), and gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 12) being most frequent. Physical function evaluated as 6-min walk distance, 4-m gait speed, and chair-stands time was significantly and clinically-meaningfully improved (p &lt; .05). Pulmonary function, clinical chemistries, frailty index (FI-LAB), and reported health were unchanged. DQ effects on circulat.ing SASP factors were inconclusive, but correlations were observed between change in function and change in SASP-related matrix-remodeling proteins, microRNAs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (23/48 markers r ≥ 0.50).

&gt; **Interpretation**  
&gt; Our first-in-humans open-label pilot supports study feasibility and provides initial evidence that senolytics may alleviate physical dysfunction in IPF, warranting evaluation of DQ in larger randomized controlled trials for senescence-related diseases.",1,1546812265,longevity

Abstract:  

&gt; **Background**  
&gt; Exposure to green vegetation has been linked to positive health, but the pathophysiological processes affected by exposure to vegetation remain unclear. To study the relationship between greenness and cardiovascular disease, we examined the association between residential greenness and biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and disease risk in susceptible individuals.

&gt; **Methods and Results**  
&gt; In this cross‐sectional study of 408 individuals recruited from a preventive cardiology clinic, we measured biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and risk in participant blood and urine. We estimated greenness from satellite‐derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in zones with radii of 250 m and 1 km surrounding the participants’ residences. We used generalized estimating equations to examine associations between greenness and cardiovascular disease biomarkers. We adjusted for residential clustering, demographic, clinical, and environmental variables. In fully adjusted models, contemporaneous NDVI within 250 m of participant residence was inversely associated with urinary levels of epinephrine (−6.9%; 95% confidence interval, −11.5, −2.0/0.1 NDVI) and F2‐isoprostane (−9.0%; 95% confidence interval, −15.1, −2.5/0.1 NDVI). We found stronger associations between NDVI and urinary epinephrine in women, those not on β‐blockers, and those who had not previously experienced a myocardial infarction. Of the 15 subtypes of circulating angiogenic cells examined, 11 were inversely associated (8.0–15.6% decrease/0.1 NDVI), whereas 2 were positively associated (37.6–45.8% increase/0.1 NDVI) with contemporaneous NDVI.  

&gt; **Conclusions**  
&gt; Independent of age, sex, race, smoking status, neighborhood deprivation, statin use, and roadway exposure, residential greenness is associated with lower levels of sympathetic activation, reduced oxidative stress, and higher angiogenic capacity.  ",3,1546044255,longevity

#So about Benzene.

**How you could be exposed to benzene**

* Outdoor air contains low levels of benzene from tobacco smoke, gas stations, motor vehicle exhaust, and industrial emissions.

* Indoor air generally contains levels of benzene higher than those in outdoor air. The benzene in indoor air comes from products that contain benzene such as glues, paints, furniture wax, and detergents.

* People working in industries that make or use benzene may be exposed to the highest levels of it.

* A major source of benzene exposure is tobacco smoke.

**How does Benzene effect us?**

* Benzene works by causing cells not to work correctly. For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood cells, which can lead to anemia. Also, it can damage the immune system by changing blood levels of antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells.

* The seriousness of poisoning caused by benzene depends on the amount, route, and **length of time of exposure**, as well as the age and preexisting medical condition of the exposed person.

**Long-term health effects of exposure to benzene**

* The major effect of benzene from long-term exposure is on the blood. (Long-term exposure means exposure of a year or more.) Benzene causes harmful effects on the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and can affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection.

* Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. It is not known whether benzene exposure affects the developing fetus in pregnant women or fertility in men.

* Animal studies have shown low birth weights, delayed bone formation, and bone marrow damage when pregnant animals breathed benzene.

* The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that benzene causes cancer in humans. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, cancer of the blood-forming organs.

&gt;Human health depends on age and evolutionary history. Firstly, adaptation is age-specific, with Hamilton's forces of natural selection leading to much greater adaptation at earlier ages than later ages. This of course is how evolutionary biologists explain the existence of aging in the first place. Secondly, when environmental conditions change, it takes surprisingly few generations for populations to adapt to such new conditions, at least at early ages when natural selection is intense. Thirdly, at later ages, when the forces of natural selection are weak, natural selection will often fail to produce adaptation to a selective environment that is not evolutionarily ancient. All three of these themes will be illustrated using both explicit mathematical theory and findings from experimental evolution. At the end of the presentation, we will apply these general scientific insights to the case of human evolutionary history, human aging, and optimal human diets.

We were very skeptical during the first day of presentations,  but the Bill Faloon (Co-founder of the Life Extension Foundation) talk on the second day made us a believer in the possibility that life could be extended by taking certain actions today such as Nad+ patches or infusions, taking metformin and  taking a combo of quercetin and datsatinab.  All of this is to be a prelude to an infusion of young person plasma and stem cells.  The goal is to extend life in good health for 15 to 20 years beyond the normal lifespan.  Bill believes that by 2030 there will be advances in CRISPR and other modalities which will reverse our aging so we could actually be younger in body and mind on  our way to eternal life.  I have known Bill for a long time and he is a straight shooter.  If you read the Life Extension magazine or the articles and protocols on their website, you will see that they are all backed by published research studies.  None of the actions Bill is proposing are based on items sold by Life Extension.  He is not in this for the money.  Yes some of the life extending actions described above are based on mice studies, but Bill feels we don't have 10 years or longer to wait for human trials and FDA approval because you could die while waiting.

,shrillthrill,"&gt; During the meeting, Dr. Barzilai delivered an award lecture entitled, “Unfolding the Secrets of Exceptional Longevity,” which included an overview of his ongoing collaboration with CohBar co-founder Dr. Pinchas Cohen and their discovery and development of mitochondrial-derived peptides as potential therapeutics for the treatment of age-related diseases.

If it was recorded, I can't see it online yet.  Only found [what looks like an abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6228605/pdf/igy023.2807.pdf), but I guess could be a small talk with slides:

&gt; A watershed moment in Gerontology occurred when it was demonstrated that altering a single gene in an organism can have a significant impact on the lifespan and health-span. A natural progression from this discovery was to ask whether human centenarians, who age slower and may live twice as long as their contemporaries, also harbor genes that explain their successful aging. This led us to embark on an in depth study of the phenotypes and the genome of families with exceptional longevity, including &gt;670 centenarians. 

&gt; Over the course of two decades we discovered that centenarians who are also protected from the negative effects of aging and are generally healthy until the end of their life span, do not follow unique lifestyles or diets, and do not have the ‘perfect’ genome. While they harbor many mutations/SNPs known to cause diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, they do not manifest these and neither do their offspring. This highlighted the importance of discovering resilience genes and pathways that protect from aging and disease causing genes. 

&gt; It led to our discoveries of a variety of genetic alterations in the growth hormone pathway in centenarians and demonstrated that reduced function of this pathway is associated with protection from aging. Several other resilience genes have been identified in this cohort, including genes that regulate lipid metabolism. Centenarians exemplified that evolutionary conserved and non-conserved mechanisms are associated with extended human health- and life-span, with some of our findings already translated by pharmaceuticals to drugs that potentially target aging",1,1543919615,longevity

As I cited elsewhere in this thread, long term metformin usage isn't effective for weight control and raises insulin resistance in obese patients (PMC6129504).

Since you are looking for Internet advice, IMO the easiest way to fix your metabolic issues: start doing 16:8 intermittent fasting, cut out all sugar and refined carbohydrates (going keto and aiming for 20g net carbs also wouldn't be a bad thing to try. Although it's not for everyone, it's by far the most effective way of eating I've seen for weight loss; see r/keto or r/ketoscience for more information), and personally, I'd recommend cutting out processed/non-real food as much as possible.

If your liver biomarkers are elevated, get the ultrasound to see if you have NAFLD, a DXA to check your ectopic visceral fat, and heck, get a low-dose CAC scan as well (it's the most effective screening method for your risk of CVD). If you have glucose issues, consider OGTT as well and potentially use a CGM to better inform effectiveness of your lifestyle modification/treatment.

Just so you know, since it sounds like you're just randomly dosing metformin (PSA: please don't just ask the internet for dosing, consult with an actual MD - metformin has many interactions and dosing modifications), here's information from... 1971 (PMC1796258)

&gt;Vitamin-B12 malabsorption has been found in 21 (30%) of 71  diabetic patients taking long-term metformin therapy in addition to  dietary management. The patients with evidence of B12  malabsorption had significantly lower haemoglobin levels (and  significantly higher serum folic acid levels) than those with normal B12 absorption. Steatorrhoea was found in only one patient. Stopping metformin therapy resulted in reversion of B12 absorption to normal in most patients examined. Four patients with B12 malabsorption were found to have pathologically low serum B12  levels. The causes and implications of these findings are discussed and  it is concluded that all patients on long-term metformin therapy should  have annual serum B12 estimations.

And a 2010 followup (PMC3019388):

&gt;After more than 50 years of use of metformin, we have come to know that metformin induced vit B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy; forcing to change the recommendation from annual screening of vit B12 levels to annual supplementation of vit B12.

I'd recommend that anyone looking to add metformin have a look at all the issues - disabling GNG is not a great thing to do, and lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and renal damage seem like very real risks. The poorly studied gut interactions are an even bigger question mark - increased GLP-1 (incretin) seems like it controls for glucose by stimulating more insulin production (all methods of adding insulin will also increase insulin resistance) - this is reflected in the latest research btw: PMC6129504. Also maybe get some microbiome snapshots - I'd be dollars to donuts we'll see plenty more studies like PMC6160085 over the next few years that show just how bad metformin (and many other drugs are) for the microbiome:

&gt;Our results are in line with previous findings on the capability of  metformin to influence gut microbiota. However, for the first time we  provide evidence that metformin has an immediate effect on the gut  microbiome in humans. It is likely that this effect results from the  increase in abundance of opportunistic pathogens and further triggers  the occurrence of side effects associated with the observed dysbiosis.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For over half a century, this agent has been prescribed to T2D patients  worldwide, yet the underlying mechanism by which metformin inhibits  hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that metformin  non-competitively inhibits the redox shuttle enzyme mitochondrial  glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), resulting in an altered  hepatocellular redox state, reduced conversion of lactate and glycerol  to glucose, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Acute and chronic  low-dose metformin treatment effectively reduced endogenous glucose  production (EGP), while increasing cytosolic redox and decreasing  mitochondrial redox states.

&amp;#x200B;

See also PMC4742508:

&gt;Although the liver is recognised as a major site of metformin  pharmacodynamics, recent evidence also implicates the gut as an  important site of action. Metformin has a number of actions within the  gut. It increases intestinal glucose uptake and lactate production,  increases GLP-1 concentrations and the bile acid pool within the  intestine, and alters the microbiome.

I suppose I could imagine people rejecting anti-aging treatments for religious or philosophical reasons.

You could argue that this would constitute a form of ""discrimination"", just as with those who have congenital illnesses they were born with. But whereas congenital problems are beyond a person's control, the issue of taking anti-aging treatments vs not doing so comes down to a matter of choice. So in my opinion, insurance companies would be perfectly entitled to charge their anti-aging-treated customers comparatively less while charging their anti-aging-objector customers more.

Given the economic incentives here, the powerful insurance industry is a natural ally to the anti-aging cause, and it needs to be enlisted as soon as possible in ushering in the era of better health through anti-aging.

The keto diet effects T3 hormone (Thyroid) by suppressing it. Leptin is also suppressed when doing keto.

I also read somewhere that glucose pathways do serve certain functions that ketones do not, though I don't know where those studies are. I plan to do an entire article on ketosis at some point. For now ketosis would seem to be better than Metformin until human clinical trials are complete, even mild ketosis through intermittent fasting should have CR benefits.  


One thing I haven't quite figured out is whether fat oxidation is an all or nothing thing, for example if you had some carb intake would that knock you out of fat oxidation completely, this is because its possible to supplement ketones and maintain a decent ketone level in plasma, whether the body will utilise this is unknown, but certainly it seems like the brain doesn't just either uptake glucose or ketone, rather it does both depending on the availability of either:

That [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413116304958?via%3Dihub#mmc2) you mentioned from the Imai Lab itself brings up some troubling points about the design of these NMN studies at least for longevity claims. For example, I think its unfortunate that they didn't just administer NMN until these mice died so we could actually see a Kaplan–Meier lifespan/survival plot and whether NMN actually does anything for longevity (you should be able to argue the health benefits promote a longevity phenotype). They had plenty of mice for it. Also, 17 weeks isn't really that old for these mice for when they checked the final effects of their treatment. I think the little guys from this strain, and I mean guys because they're only using males, live to about 900 days max (so they're stopping to look at effects at ~13% of potential lifespan, which is pretty young). This concerns me because nearly all of our longevity drugs don’t have the same effect in males as they do in females.

I've asked myself before why Sinclair doesn't just propose NR or NMN for the NIA ITP if he's so sure that it works as a pro-longevity compound. [NAM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413118301128#bib22) was already shown to have no effect on longevity in mice and actually repress NAD salvage, which is interesting because increasing NAD levels via NMN or NR would presumably increase NAM production as well, thus counteracting the NAD boost.

,dataflux,"ABSTRACT

We are able to read this because of quantum and thermodynamic principles that via an inorganic proton gradient, possibly generated 4.2 billion years ago, gave rise to a system that has an awareness of time and space by using energy to integrate information. Life can be described as a dissipative system driven by an energy gradient that uses information to positively reinforce its self-sustaining structure, which in turn increases its non-linear decisional capacity. Key in the evolution of life has been stress coupled to natural selection, which usually meant an increased demand for energy. As hormesis describes the adaptive response to stress, we propose that hormesis embraces not only the evolution of life, but that of intelligence itself, as natural selection would favour systems that enhances its efficiency. A component of the hormetic response in eukaryotes is the mitochondrion, which itself relies on quantum effects such as tunnelling. This suggests that quantum effects control the stability of individual cells as well as long-lived cellular networks. Hormesis, which can be anti-inflammatory, is therefore key in maintaining the functional stability of complex systems, including the brain. In contrast, a lack of classical hormetic factors, such as physical activity, plant polyphenols, or calorie restriction, will lead to accelerated cognitive decline, which is associated with increased inflammation. However, there may be another previously unidentified factor that could also be considered hormetic, and that is thinking itself. Here we propose that the process of “thinking”, and managing complex movement, induces “stress” in the neuronal system and is therefore in itself part of maintaining cognitive health and reserve throughout life. In effect, the right amount of thinking and information processing can beneficially induce adaptation, and this itself could be explainable by quantum thermodynamics.",7,1540754585,longevity
,brberg,"The problem with these studies is that a lot of terminal diseases cause weight loss. The better studies try to control for this by excluding people who've been diagnosed with serious diseases, but this doesn't totally eliminate the problem, because sometimes weight loss occurs prior to diagnosis.

An interesting new methodology involves looking at lifetime maximum weight instead of weight at the beginning of the follow-up period. Theoretically this should rule out bias due to pre-clinical wasting from terminal disease. Not only is this a much stronger predictor of mortality than weight at the beginning of the follow-up period, but it eliminates the ""overweight paradox""; as expected the lowest mortality rate is in the normal-weight group.

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02308228

&gt; Muscle mass and strength are critical determinants not only of a person's quality of life and functional independence, but also metabolic health, as muscle is the organ primarily responsible for insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The elderly suffer obligatory losses of muscle mass and strength, exacerbated by illness and physical inactivity. Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) is the most effective intervention identified to improve muscular strength, and combat the muscle atrophy of aging (sarcopenia); however, overall the muscle response to PRT is blunted in the elderly and variability of response increased, with some individuals actually losing muscle mass. The Bamman and Peterson labs have independently been studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the ""non-responder"" phenotype, with the goal of identifying novel intervention strategies to promote mass and strength gains to improve function. 

&gt; We hypothesize that the abundance of anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated M2 macrophages in muscle predicts response to PRT in the elderly; those with the highest number of M2 macrophages and lowest inflammatory gene expression prior to the start of training gained the most mass. Further, we determined that metformin treatment increased M2 macrophage abundance, and decreased inflammatory cytokine gene expression. 

&gt; These provocative findings have led us to our central hypothesis that adjuvant metformin may improve the responses to PRT in the elderly by altering the muscle tissue inflammatory environment, thereby enhancing mechanisms that drive PRT-induced myofiber hypertrophy.

In a linked paper in this issue, Lai and colleagues (doi:[10.1136/bmj.k4067](https://www.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmj.k4067)) investigate the association between circulating levels of **omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFAs)** and ~~healthy~~ *less shitty* ageing in a sample of adults with a mean age of 74 years at baseline who were followed for up to 22 years in the Cardiovascular Health Study.

 

Plasma phospholipid n3-PUFAs levels were measured at baseline and at six and 13 years, providing an objective assessment of four individual n3-PUFAs: two derived largely from seafood (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), one predominately endogenous (docosapentaenoic acid), and one derived largely from plants (α-linolenic acid).

 group with the highest cumulative mean concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid from seafood had a 24% **lower** risk of ~~unhealthy~~  *more shitty* ageing than the group with the lowest concentrations 

For the predominantly endogenously metabolized docosapentaenoic acid, the top three groups had an 18% to 21% reduction in the risk of ~~unhealthy~~ *more shitty* ageing, relative to the lowest group. 

Docosahexaenoic acid from seafood and α-linolenic acid from plants were not associated with ~~healthy~~  *less shitty* ageing.

 A rich body of literature suggests a protective role of **n3-PUFAs in reducing cardiovascular risk.**

 Interestingly, after additional adjustment for fish intake, the association between higher docosahexaenoic acid concentration and healthy ageing became noticeable. This might suggest that metabolically determined levels of docosahexaenoic acid have a greater role in ~~healthy~~ *less shitty* ageing than dietary determined docosahexaenoic acid. 

 Secondly, associations between eicosapentaenoic acid and ~~healthy~~ *less shitty*  ageing and between combined eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid and ~~healthy~~  *less shitty* ageing were only significant in the highest group.  

 

we cannot rule out the possibility of differential exposures across the n3-PUFA quintiles to unmeasured chronic and acute stressors related to socioeconomic resources.

 . The limited variation in α-linolenic acid concentrations and vegetable intakes in this predominantly white study population may have contributed to the null association between α-linolenic acid derived from plants and ~~healthy~~  *less shitty* ageing.

 Epidemiological associations cannot infer causality, so we caution against using these findings to inform public health policy or nutritional guidelines. ",5,1540358594,longevity

You are right that increasing angiogenesis in the context of cancer is bad. However, as long as you don't have cancer, that is nothing to worry about. Methionine restriction has actually been shown to dramatically reduce cancer risk, despite increasing angiogenesis. Exercise also induces angiogenesis in the brain, yet is not known to promote brain tumor formation.

Also, many chemicals have pro-angiogenesis properties in healthy tissue, but anti-angiogenesis properties in cancer cells.

Rationalists should definitely be mindful of the epistemic status (low-confidence, medium, etc.) of their claims and to be effective in communicating it. I think the rationalists community can fail in that regard with persuading others because their comparative advantage often isn’t usually in the social skills/public persuasion arena. 

The streetlight effect definitely plays a big part in what research gets done and I understand that often times research isn’t about research ala Robin Hanson: [http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html)

You could try reading from a recent review (click through to get the PDF): [DNA methylation-based biomarkers and the epigenetic clock theory of ageing (2018)] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ken_Raj/publication/324447658_DNA_methylation-based_biomarkers_and_the_epigenetic_clock_theory_of_ageing/links/5ad495c00f7e9b28593695f6/DNA-methylation-based-biomarkers-and-the-epigenetic-clock-theory-of-ageing.pdf?origin=publication_detail)

**Abstract**:

&gt; Identifying and validating molecular targets of interventions that extend the human health span and lifespan has been difficult, as most clinical biomarkers are not sufficiently representative of the fundamental mechanisms of ageing to serve as their indicators. In a recent breakthrough, biomarkers of ageing based on DNA methylation data have enabled accurate age estimates for any tissue across the entire life course. These 'epigenetic clocks' link developmental and maintenance processes to biological ageing, giving rise to a unified theory of life course. Epigenetic biomarkers may help to address long-standing questions in many fields, including the central question: why do we age? ",1,1539326875,longevity
,9sovereign,"IMO, the current research attitude is very heavily influenced by institutional pressures: There's billions of dollars allocated for research on individual diseases, cancer, heart disease, because people know that one of their loved ones died from those causes and thus create advocacy around this. Longevity is vague, aging has not taken the cultural umbrella yet. The FDA does not consider aging a disease, e.g. for metformin and fisetin the aging-related clinical trials all happen in contorted forms after targeted-disease approval or for already-safe compounds. If there is one single politically powerful advocate for this idea in government, even redirecting 1% of federal funds in this direction would be a huge boon.

I mostly agree with the ""more impactful"" designation as well. However, in a rationalist mindset you do have to be cautious in being overconfident that your idea or measurement of impact is the right one: And even if it is, you need to find effective, persuasive ways to communicate it as such. The top minds in the overall ""umbrella"" of aging don't all agree on what the best approach is.

Some people are skeptical that there are longevity dividends to be reaped, and many are skeptical that the SENS approach is the correct one. Others think that tackling cardiovascular diseases directly will yield a concrete, pure payoff, while aging is vague and unknown still. In all the health-related fields, what is indeed the most impactful? I don't think the best of us have a consensus yet. However, I do think \*way more\* people and money should be betting on the longevity payoff, because there is enough confidence that it's right and payoff if real. 

I don't think we should expect government to be run on a purely utilitarian, altruistic model either since that's not how people tend to shake out. The Emperor of All Maladies is an amazing book that covers cancer from the very beginning to fights and lobbying of powerful Senators in the mid-century to secure funding to create a War on Cancer.

The downstream vs. upstream argument is very interesting. You'd want to calculate the chance that you are ""right"", and then based on that confidence do a particular allocation. Maybe a Kelly Criterion-style bet. Clearly 0% aging research is probably wrong, but so is 90%.",1,1539319367,longevity

,Martorel96,"Thinking about Aubreys book ""Ending aging"" and how it's surely a great help in getting the word out there - no doubt, but I believe that (no offence) the 10-15% of his book he spends on demystifying aging and simple explaining how it's, (obviously) the root-cause of many horrible chronic diseases etc. is by far the most important part. Sure, the biomedical part is very important to back it all up of course - but it's not important to the 99% of the population who are non-scientific people. Personally, I had a hard time understand the biomedical stuff - even though he put a lot of effort in simplifying the part. The biggest societal problem with the ""pro-aging"" trance is the extreme degree of irrationality - the fact that people actually believes that there can exist  a world without Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cancer but in the same world people would still be aging is extremely irrational, frustrating and worrying!

b)  whether higher than average amounts of cardio have an effect on joint health, and some reach the conclusion that it doesn't negatively affect it:

&gt; Нere is mounting evidence showing that increase in level of exercise lowers the musculoskeletal disability, pain and improvement in functional capacity [14,15]. Нe Stanford University Runner’s study, which lasted for about 21 years, showed that morbidity and mortality were less among runners compared to the controls 

&gt; In the Framingham study, the eوٴects of recreational physical activity on development of knee OA were studied on 1279 subjects, and it conٽrmed that recreational or higher activity than peers does not increase the risk of OA knee or results in reduction of joint space. Нe study also could not ٽnd detrimental eوٴect of activity even in people with high BMI (mean BMI &gt;30 kg/m) [1

From the conclusion of the study:

&gt; 1. “There is no evidence for advancing knee OA in active people who does exercise. This is true in the case of long distant runners. Evidences support the role of exercise in improving musculoskeletal disability, pain and functional capacity.”

&gt; 2. “Many years of follow up of runners could not find any concrete evidence linking running with development of osteoarthritis of knees.”

&gt; 3. “Interestingly, running seems to reduce the need of knee replacement by around 50% compared with non-runners. Previous injury is a strong predictor development of knee osteoarthritis in runners.”

Life Biosciences LLC, the longevity startup founded by Harvard researcher David Sinclair and funded by WeWork’s Adam Neumann, is ramping up an expansion of its bid to become the world’s largest company dedicated to antiaging drugs.

Launched publicly in April, the Cambridge, Mass.- based company has six subsidiaries across four continents. Adding to that, it just acquired Lua Technologies Inc., a health-care communications company, to power Life Biosciences’ research collaboration platform. No financial terms of the acquisition were disclosed.

To continue global expansion efforts, Life Biosciences is also looking to raise up to $25 million in new financing, according to a regulatory filing. The company wouldn’t comment on the filing, nor on how much capital it has raised to date. Mr. Neumann, who serves on Life Biosciences’ board, is the only disclosed investor thus far.

Through a WeWork spokesperson, Mr. Neumann declined to comment.

Some of the most heavily funded longevity startups like Unity Biotechnology , now public, focus on just one or a few aging-related diseases like osteoarthritis and vision loss. Life Biosciences is aiming for an all-encompassing gambit: to own all the best research, drug-development pipelines, intellectual property and financing opportunities for the entire sector.

For the past three years, the company has operated quietly amid a surge of activity from other venture-backed longevity startups. In the past year, Life Biosciences’ workforce has grown to 90 employees, including the hiring of several veteran pharmaceutical and IT executives into key leadership positions. Logitech Chief Executive Bracken Darrell serves on the board of directors and the company’s chief financial officer is Brian Malone, the former chief financial officer of Longwood Fund Management. Life Biosciences co-founder Tristan Edwards serves as chief executive officer.

“Our thesis was to have a land grab of the best people before we let ourselves be known and have competition. We have achieved that now,” said Mr. Sinclair, a renowned geneticist and serial entrepreneur who serves as chairman and head of the company’s investment committee.

Life Biosciences’ portfolio covers a range of longevity research and therapeutics including drugs to target metabolic diseases like diabetes, the use of stem cells to aid in senescent, or so-called “zombie” cell removal, and compounds to prolong life for pets. Two of Life Biosciences’ current companies, Senolytic Therapeutics Inc. and Jumpstart Fertility Inc., were acquired at a very early stage while the other four were formed in-house.

Life Biosciences has also secured several prominent aging and longevity researchers including Dr. Nir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who will serve as the company’s chief medical adviser.

Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly reported Dr. Nir Barzilai’s title as chief medical officer. He is the company’s chief medical adviser. (Oct. 1, 2018)

You can find a multitude of different diet radically different from each other on the web. Most of them will try to explain more or less scientifically why they are the biochemically sound one. This is a minefield where science can rapidly be abandoned in favour of politic and ideology. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile some interesting studies tend to find that genetic differences might explain why people react differently to the same diet. I think this is just the tip of the iceberg and we will find that there is also many non genetic factors that can explain the different reaction encountered by people switching to the same diet. This is just too multi-factorial to be able to make any generalisation.

This is interesting as the gap is widening while the industry jobs tend to pay more than many service jobs. So it seem that while sport is good, forced physical activity might not be so much.

,AlwaysUnite,"&gt;Alcohol

[Any amount of alcohol raises all cause mortality.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997174)

&gt; There is [are] very few people having nutritional deficiencies in the western world. This only concern people who are engineering a overly complicated diet from scratch.

80-90% of Western people do not get enough vitamin D for optimum health. [See papers cited here](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-optimal-dose-of-vitamin-d-based-on-natural-levels/). This makes sense of course. We evolved as a naked ape species running around in the sunny savannahs of Eastern Africa. Then we started doing weird things like wearing clothes, moving to the poles of the planet, making houses and other buildings and using glass everywhere. All of this has caused us to live in UV-radiation caves where our skin is deprived of UV-B radiation which it needs to make the vital hormone vitamin D (vitamin D is not a real vitamin since it is produced by the body it is just treated that way because vitamin D production is so lacking that we have to get it via our diets most of the time). 

Most people are also severely deficient in fiber and vitamin c compared to optimum levels. These deficiencies are not enough to cause scurvy but they do have a range of negative effects throughout the body.

&gt; Exercise

There is no known upper limit to the benefits of exercise. Mortality simply drops the more you exercise. There are currently not enough studies to do a proper meta-analysis of long term exercise of more than 90 minutes a day. Of course if your exercise consists of base-jumping and climbing the K2 your mortality is going to be sky high (pun intended) but not because exercise is harmful but because that particular exercise is dangerous. See [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22039197) and [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20630992) metastudy. This of course also makes sense. We live very relaxed wealthy lives compared to our evolutionary past. Our bodies evolved to work best doing lots of (moderate intensity) exercise. Nowadays people get almost no exercise at all.

&gt;No processed foods

Processed foods such as sweets, candy, white bread, chips, fries, ice cream, cakes, biscuits, etc. are foods with almost no nutrient density at all. During the processing fiber, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids are removed. Refined oils, refined sugars and salt are added instead. All of this is very detrimental to health.

&gt; Sugar

Any form of refined sugar, be it glucose, fructose, lactose, etc. without the other nutrients that your body expects and needs to get simultaneously [will harm your health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493081). Refined sugar is an independent risk factor for the number one cause of death in the US, heart disease. This makes sense as well. Our bodies evolved to handle the amounts of sugar commonly found in plants from eating plants. We've since figured out a way to extract the sugar without having to eat the rest of the plant. This is wreaking havoc on our metabolism. The average American consumes more than half a dozen meters of sugar cane plant per day in sugar equivalent. If you had to eat the actual plant you simply wouldn't be able to do it in a day.

&gt; Salt

There were no salt shakers on the savanah. We evolved a sense to like salty foods because they were extremely rare and we still had to get a small bit of the stuff from time to time. However as our technology advanced we started making crystaline salt and adding it to our foods to preserve them better and improve the taste. This has caused a massive global epidemic of hypertension despite the invention of blood pressure lowering medication. As the NaK pump insures the Na stays in the blood instead of the cells the salinity of the blood vs the salinity of our cells shoots up. Physics tries to undo this imbalance through osmosis by moving water into the blood thereby raising blood pressure. The only currently known populations with blood pressures of ~100/60 which is natural for our species are several Amazon tribes, people on the Kempner rice diet, rural Africans who can't buy salt, babies (who haven't had time to have their blood pressure go up with time) and vegans (vegetarians have an almost perfect blood pressure only 5-10 points above ideal). For the paper describing the officially recommended DASH diet (a reduced refined salt intake diet) and why it is not the optimal diet [see here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7795829). For a general overview of why salt is bad for you [this will be a good start](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-evidence-that-salt-raises-blood-pressure/).

&gt; Vegan

**Humans are omnivoric frugi-starchivores**. *Evolutionarily we are adapted to a plant based diet (~+95%) of mostly roots and fruits, with some leaves, nuts and seeds and the occasional handful of grasshoppers or more rarely a rabbit.* This ~95% plant based diet is what we ate over millions of years during our evolution from monkeys to the apes we are today and consequently it is what our bodies work best on. If you eat anything else your health will suffer. We have several lines of evidence that our ancestors ate this way. The modern lifestyle that approaches this best is the vegan lifestyle (since people consuming animal products usually eat bacon and not inner organs and bone marrow).

***Primatology*** Chimpanzees our closest still existing cousins have the diets which contain only an estimated 2% of meat, insects and other animal sources (See: *Goodall, Jane (1986). The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior. ISBN 0-674-11649-6*, *&amp; this site [(11)](http://www.allaboutwildlife.com/what-do-chimps-eat)*). And this diet does not just include our direct evolutionary pathway, it stretches back tens of millions of years to at least the common ancestor with the baboons, who are also mainly herbivores. Baboons spend 79.9% of their feeding time on getting grass, leaves and roots, 18.1% on fruits, seeds and flowers and only 2% on animal protein (*R. H. Tuttle, 1975, Socioecology and Psychology of Primates. Paper by R. Harding. Meat-Eating and Hunting in Baboons, [p.247](https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tlS1BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=baboon+meat+diet&amp;ots=cGPsrq0OD0&amp;sig=Y8MqyDdaBzaLHVWvAqnSnSZoLLI#v=onepage&amp;q=baboon%20meat%20diet&amp;f=false)*). Rowell too, shows in (Forest Living Baboons in Uganda, 1966, p.359) that baboons eat a ""mainly herbivorous diet supplemented by animal protein."" [(8)](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1966.tb04054.x).

In fact if we look at all primate species studied there is only one species, [the Tarsier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsier) which will die without animals as part of its diet and which is therefore an obligate carnivore and their diet is mainly insectivorous (see:  *Wright, P., Simmons, E. &amp; Gursky, S. (2003). ""Introduction"". In Wright, P.; Simmons, E.; Gursky, S. Tarsiers Past, Present and Future. Rutgers University Press. p. 1. ISBN 0-8135-3236-1.*)

[Dietary advanced glycation end products and their relevance for human health (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163718301193?via%3Dihub)

Abstract:

&gt; Due to their bioactivity and harmful potential, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are discussed to affect human health. AGEs are compounds formed endogenously in the human body andexogenously, especially, in foods while thermal processing. 

&gt; In contrast to endogenous AGEs, dietary AGEs are formed in much higher extent. However, their risk potential is also depending on absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. 

&gt; For over 10 years an intense debate on the risk of dietary AGEs on human health is going on. On the one hand, studies provided evidence that dietary AGEs contribute to clinical outcomes. On the other hand, human studies failed to observe any association. Because it was not possible to draw a final conclusion, the call for new interdisciplinary approaches arose. In this review, we will give an overview on the current state of scientific knowledge in this field. In particular, we focus on (I) the occurrence of AGEs in foods and the daily uptake of AGEs, (II) contribution to endogenous levels and (III) the effect on health-/disease-related biomarkers in humans.

Interesting figure: [The fate of consumed AGEs in the human body.](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1568163718301193-gr2_lrg.jpg)

&gt; There is increasing evidence that dietary AGEs are absorbed in the digestive tract and circulate in the blood stream until they are eliminated in the urine. However, do dietary AGEs also cause increased tissue AGE levels? The knowledge of uptake, distribution and excretion are also summarized in Fig. 2.

Seems like there are some unknowns as it's not extensively studied in humans.   Maybe it gets worse with age?  

&gt;  It was postulated that dietary AGEs (mainly CML and Methylglyoxal) are the most important source, whereas endogenously formed AGEs represent minor components (Vlassara et al., 2002). Dietary AGEs and highly processed food are regarded to detrimentally influence the composition of the human microbiota. 

ah, yowza... inhibiting SIRT1 is not good:

&gt; The dietary AGEs, however, not only modify the human microbiota composition, they directly influence AD development by chronic suppression of SIRT1 and other host defenses as it was show by Cai and co-workers focusing on elevated serum levels of methylglyoxal in older humans 

Overall, the review does a good job pointing out the shortcomings of the existing research:

&gt; Existing studies are controversial, inconclusive or of low quality so that further high-quality studies from independent research groups are needed to clarify the role of dietary AGEs.

,chasonreddit,"I'll take a cut at this because I think the question answers itself if you ask the questions properly.

I'll start with ""would you rather still age"".  You *will* still age.  Every year you will be one year older.  There is no getting around that.  What I think you are asking is ""would you rather exhibit some signs of aging"". 

""what age will you choose"":  Again, you don't choose, you will get older. What physiological age is also kind of meaningless, as people physiologically age quite differently.  

And finally let's be careful with the word eternal.  That's a big word.  Longevity =!= immortality.   

The science fiction image of immortality treatments seems to be one of two:  You pick an age and freeze it right there, or you age fairly normally, and ""rejuvenate"" to some earlier age on a regular basis.  These are bad ways to think about it and neither is likely to resemble any future scientific processes.  

So to answer the question, I would choose to maintain my body's individual systems at their optimums.  For some systems this might resemble what they were when I was 18.  For some when I was 25. For some they've actually never been optimal so let's fix that.  But so far we are only talking about physical health.

I'll throw another monkey wrench in here.  I just happen to be re-reading ""Methusla's Children"" the grand-daddy of all longevity science fiction stories.  It brings up an interesting point.  Experience or knowledge accumulates linearly with time.  Interconnections between experiences grow exponentially with the number.  The human brain is finite.

,shrillthrill,"I've skimmed it (having more specific commentary on the advice is on my todo list) , but superficially the advice on supplements etc is pretty bad.   If you want to look at what evidence exists for a particular supplement, Examine.com is a very good resource as it has compiled summaries based on most of the available research - and they do not have a conflict of interest in selling any supplements (they only sell a subscription to research summaries).

In an interview, Kurzweil actually said once he doesn't understand the research behind any of the recommendations, he was just told by someone that it would be useful due to his specific health conditions (he has diabetes) - which is in line with /r/supplements being useful to manage some aspects of whatever health condition you may have, though hopefully it is not as serious as an age related disease.

I think in retrospect, Kurzweil is more interested in what future research and technological innovation can bring for attacking age related damage rather than any kind of supplement that was on the market when he wrote that book.  Currently people spend billions of dollars on supplements, and I suspect on sum, it's a net negative for humanity when you look at the number of people dying from age related disease per day being 100k+, and the relative lack of funding.",1,1536361221,longevity
,shrillthrill,"&gt; And I guess some follow up questions would be things like...what is the single thing or few things you can do to live a longer and healthier life. I'm guessing maintaining a normal body weight is the answer? But I don't know.


The behaviours that lead to excess body fat (calorie excess, sedentary lifestyle) are those that end up cause dysfunction and disease like diabetes.   It's entirely avoidable, so it makes sense to avoid it.

&gt; I also understand that outliers in these lifestyle factors could kill you very quickly (morbidly obese, severe alcoholics, etc.). So I guess im looking for numbers that are closer to the middle.

Some oncologists would suggest that no level of alcohol is preferable:

http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155

The thing is about asking for specific numbers, 2 years or 20 years - there are so many different things that could happen on the individual level, it's difficult to make it relatable to yourself with any hard degree of certainty.   When the number of years are thrown around, it's an average increase in lifespan, there will still be people at a lower end of the distribution... which is why research and advocacy (which drives research funding and policy changes) is so important right now.

If you implement extra servings of vegetables, cut down on adding oil to everything, and cut out refined sugar, you may buy a few extra years, or you may fall victim to some other aspect of age related disease for which you had more susceptibility.   For example, the immune system declines which is why old people often die from infections, and there appears to be no lifestyle intervention to save you from that - or from the types of cancer that appear late in life.

I can't really stress enough how crucial work on aging is compared to equating health with the perfect diet and workout.   Yes, certainly - avoiding small amounts of damage is good, but pales in comparison in context - one should be thinking about the bigger picture. 

&gt; If you started adding all these factors together, maybe they could add up to something that matters a little more. I'm not horribly concerned about shaving 2 years off of my life, but I would be concerned about 20 years.

I think most would be of the view it's more like 2 years.  A 20 year figure is something that people interested in longevity research and interventions (as found on the roadmap) would hope to bring about by 1-2 interventions succeeding in the next 20-30 years.   The idea being that if we can topple one or two areas of age related damage, we could buy more time to do more research and development.

,shrillthrill,"Per the sidebar, lifestyle is generally off-topic because of how little difference it makes to the inevitable accumulation of damage in the [hallmarks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/) and the pathology that results (age related disease), especially in the face of some people just having superior genetics letting them survive with damage for longer, or worse and pathology cutting their life short despite exercise and eating well.   i.e. lifestyle doesn't improve average lifespan much and some advice is rather speculative if drawing on animal research, it only helps move some people from earlier in the curve to later ([Compression of morbidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_of_morbidity)).

##Is there a diet specifically studied in humans for longevity/autophagy? 

The Longo lab's fasting-mimicking diet is a 5 day vegan (low in methionine) diet which provides 1100 kcal on day 1 (11% protein, 46% fat, and 43% carbohydrate), and 720 kcal (9% protein, 44% fat, and 47% carbohydrate) on days 2-5. Sales of a commercial version [Prolon](https://prolonfmd.com/fasting-mimicking-diet/) are being used to fund the research, but anyone can construct meals to fit the diet at home out of legumes and vegetables.   The diet is founded in both animal research of longevity and healthspan, as well as data and observation of blue zones.

##Does that mean high protein, body builder type diets are bad?

There may be no negative effects observed acutely, as high amounts of dietary protein do not appear to harm healthy humans based on biomarkers of kidney function.  [See Examine.com: Can eating too much protein be bad for you](https://examine.com/nutrition/can-eating-too-much-protein-be-bad-for-you/)

The question becomes given what we know about restricting methionine in animal models, and the longest lived populations having a low protein diet, also lower in methionine for eating protein from plant based sources like legumes, how can it be reconciled?  More speculatively: health effects may also be mediated by encouraging gut bacteria associated with better health, which a high protein diet may discourage.

There is preliminary evidence that eating a high protein diet may reduce NAD+ levels, as one additional mechanism: [High protein intake is associated with low plasma NAD+ levels in a healthy human cohort (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114226)

##Is there anything that can help offset a high protein intake?

Maybe. There's [an extensive literature](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22methionine+restriction%22&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;as_sdt=1%2C19&amp;amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;amp;as_ylo=1994&amp;amp;amp;as_yhi=) on methionine restriction as a major contributor to lifespan extension by caloric and protein restriction, and also nearly 50 years of studies indicating that *glycine may be semiessential, can clear excess methionine via [glycine N-methyltransferase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine_N-methyltransferase), and that supplementation with glycine (or serine, which freely interconverts) may mimic methionine restriction*, while cysteine supplementation abrogates benefits from methionine restriction. The figures in [Fukada et al 2008](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1271/bbb.70833) are especially informatiive.

&gt;Our study reveals that antibiotic-induced gut microbiota depletion abrogates the body weight-lowering and metabolism-benefitting effects of calorie restriction. Furthermore, the FMT experiment clearly indicates that the gut microbiota from the CR mice is able to alleviate obesity in DIO mice. These data thus indicate for the first time that 

#gut microbiota plays a causal role to mediate the beneficial effects of calorie restriction.

&gt;Therefore, the **gut microbiota plays an important role to ensure that calorie restriction can bring about various beneficial activities such as lowering body weight and maintaining a high level of basal metabolic rate, decreasing blood glucose level and reducing serum cholesterol level**. Antibiotic treatment, therefore, largely abolishes the metabolism-regulatory functions of gut microbiota and abrogates the health-beneficial effect of gut microbiota.

&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; **Calorie restriction (CR) extends lifespan and elicits numerous effects beneficial to health and metabolism in various model organisms, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood**. Gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with the beneficial effects of CR; however, it is unknown whether these effects of CR are causally mediated by gut microbiota. In this study, we employed an antibiotic-induced microbiota-depleted mouse model to investigate the functional role of gut microbiota in CR. Depletion of gut microbiota rendered mice resistant to CR-induced loss of body weight, accompanied by the increase in fat mass, the reduction in lean mass and the decline in metabolic rate. Depletion of gut microbiota led to increases in fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels independent of CR. A few metabolism-modulating hormones including leptin and insulin were altered by CR and/or gut microbiota depletion. In addition, CR altered the composition of gut microbiota with significant increases in major probiotic genera such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, together with the decrease of Helicobacter. In addition, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation in mice fed with high-fat diet. Mice with transferred microbiota from calorie-restricted mice resisted high fat diet-induced obesity and exhibited metabolic improvement such as alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation. Collectively, these data indicate that CR-induced metabolic improvement especially in body weight reduction is mediated by intestinal microbiota to a certain extent.

Is that a side effect of it being rushed to be commercialised and marketed in Russia, and online?  Will they stand up to scrutiny? What will we say about them in 30-50 years?

&gt; supposedly quite acclaimed in Russia

I can think of political reasons for promoting that view.  Yet, is anyone doing remarkably well in terms of general health or survival there compared to other countries?  Not as far as I know.  

&gt;  Prof Khavinson cites political barriers, but i'm not sure if that is merely a smoke screen.

From what I've merely heard about the research (since reading every paper is still on my todo-list), the animals used are non-standard in the international research community (only used in Russia / former soviet union) - so there is one political barrier.   

The mechanisms may not be well defined enough to promote interest to an international audience to further foundational research -- something that would happen if they published in quality international journals like Cell or Nature.


If Khavinson or anyone really. wanted to do something at the basic research level to investigate the Russian peptides - why not use Horvath's clock?  That would be enough to publish or present as research to the international community.   It's relatively inexpensive now and reported to be more robust as a biomarker of aging than telomeres, and perhaps less work than investigating the results against the hallmarks. 

Even if they do have some marginal effect on animal lifespan, the question that should be asked is whether it's just a bit of metabolic tweaking, like resveratrol - how does it even matter (or would it even be a loss to focus on) when compared to the SENS style approaches of targeting the hallmarks of aging in terms of actual rejuvenation?  

Maybe the therapies on the roadmap have more research potential and promise? https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/  Personally I would think that investing in such companies, or donating to SENS to continue foundational research, or LEAF/lifespan.io to work on advocacy and raising public interest in treating age related disease has much more potential value.


&gt;  I greatly appreciate any insight and do not wish to purchase the drugs only for it to have no effect.

It could also have side effects.  

If anyone does want to self-experiment, there are considerations, and here are some resources to think about how one would do it wisely:

https://www.fightaging.org/self-experimentation/

&gt; Trust Data, Not Hope

&gt; Measurement is critical to self-experimentation. Our hopes and impressions fool our senses. Without measurement, it is pointless to try to gain early access to the first potential rejuvenation therapies. 

&gt; How would one determine whether or not it worked? Only measurement allows us to assess the quality of therapies. While self-experiments are not rigorous science, with groups of people in a study and scientific controls, it is nonetheless the case that, if carried out by enough distinct individuals who report before and after measurements, they can help to point the way.

You are taking this one sentence without the context of the rest of my comment. It is optimal to have several sets of values as opposed to the one. So not only is it easier but it is also optimal. Progress would stagnate and the problems and number of the people with a level below a functioning competency would rise. They would have no use in society. 

&gt; There are things that are pretty much universal unless you're a psychopath. One of these thing is valuing good health for everyone. It's just part of the foundation of a functioning society.  

His (dclnvctr) comment is pertaining to the valuing of celebrities over astronauts and  and not your comment on  valuing good health for everyone. I am simply justifying the value of entertainment of which he is calling people misguided for holding such values. Let people value celebrities if they wish and a hierarchy will develop that will provide well needed entertainment which is also, as you say,  ""just part of the foundation of a functioning society"". You can value celebrities and astronauts at the same time of course but just because someone acts in a way that is more aligned with a valuing of celebrities does not mean they are misguided. People play the cards they are dealt and sometimes it is not in their best interests to dedicate their focus to  intellectual pursuits and to leave it to people more able . Society only works if individuals needs are met as well as the collective because no one person is the same. 

&gt; If you make health care top priority, that doesn't mean that people get left behind(on the contrary...) or that whoever is not a doctor is a useless slug. It just means that whoever directly improves healthcare gets more rewards than anyone else. You still get rewarded for indirectly helping healthcare. There's a wide spectrum of things that helps it ""indirectly""... You just get rewarded less than the doctor. There are still other things that are valued and people will pursue them but, as a society, our main objective would be healthcare. 

Healthcare is already a priority for those who value it most. There is already a hierarchy for this and those at the top are doing all they can to increase our health and longevity.  Its importance in relation to other values is subject to debate and must be balanced with progress in other areas. That's what politics is for and the practical application of prioritizing healthcare  holds many problems.

So instead of these people being and feeling worthless in their pursuit of those values, perhaps they can be more successful in pursuing a different set of values.

However, there seems to be lack of urgency to prevent such causes (there are counterexamples - Future of Humanity Institute, Giving Pledge, SENS etc but the prevalence of disinterest and low resource allocation still remains).

This can be seen with technology also and I think the stagnation hypothesis makes a lot of sense.

We're concerned with possessions, entertainment, food, the next TV show, hot celebrity gossip, our obsession with sport, politics or status.

""This plasmid gene therapy can restore youthful levels of GHRH hormone to compensate for aging. By the time a person is 70 years old, GHRH levels are roughly 20% of a 20 year old. GHRH has direct effects, particularly on health of the cardiac muscle. It also stimulates release of growth hormone, but through normal mechanisms, and doesn’t result in the overdose effects that can occur in HGH supplementation. 

GHRH plasmid gene therapy has been as good as antibiotics at preventing infection in cattle, and it has helped dogs receiving cancer chemotherapy treatment. GHRH plasmid gene therapy has treated kidney failure. GHRH plasmid gene therapy improves ability to withstand heat stress, and its supplementation improves cognition.

A  GHRH molecule has an 8-12 minute half-life in the bloodstream, which makes it a difficult hormone to supplement. Thus, it is an excellent candidate for plasmid gene therapy, because with plasmid gene therapy, the hormone is produced continually.""",2,1535251475,longevity

Current senolytics clearly beneficially remove large numbers of senescent cells, but there may be subtypes of senescent cells that are avoiding the current senolytics to keep causing disease. These cells could be identified by single cell gene expression sequencing, but current oil droplet in water single cell sorting is low throughput, expensive, and gives high false positive rates for indicating two genes are being expressed at once in a cell. Electroporating barcoded DNA origami that targets the mRNA of specific genes into cells  will allow researchers to economically discover if two or more genes are expressed in a single cell, without the need for single cell oil droplet sorting.

With beta amyloid (alzheimers) downregulation of endocytosis can delay the spread of amyloid pathology, and vice versa, indicating that amyloid may actually be causing cell death intra cellularly at the endosomes by rupturing them. It may, therefore, be possible to prevent vesicle rupture by delivering a potent antiamyloid protease to the lysosome, circumventing the microvascular side-effects of targeting extracellular amyloid with antibodies.

In the american system, the burden of medical care might be the single largest expense as people come to their last decade.

&gt; Let’s recap what’s the deal with pensions as things stand. When people reach the age of 65 or so, they retire (that is, they stop working and produce zero wealth) and receive a pension (aka free money) from the State. In theory, a pension is something you’ve already earned when you were young and working, and the State only gives you back the money it has kept on a side for you all your life; in practice, it seems the pension system may run out of money fairly soon both in US and possibly in Europe, and it may face a serious crisis around 2050, when the number of 80-year-old people and older is expected to be around five times as high as it is now

&gt; Naturally, you can’t just keep pushing retirement age up if people’s healthspan stays the same. Even without rejuvenation therapies, we can still expect people to live for a little longer time in the future, because of progress in geriatrics and technology. Living to see your 100th birthday may become more common, but your health will still be sucky once you hit a certain threshold. The elderly won’t be able to support themselves for much longer than they currently can, and all we’re going to achieve this way is a longer time during which the older generation will have to be supported by the younger generation. The bottom line is, people may well end up consuming wealth for longer than they produce it. Unless we can draw money out of nowhere, we have only two ways of dealing with the problem: Either we stop paying pensions, or we make people able to work regardless of their age.

&gt; Now, before you complain that after having worked for 40 years you have all the right to sit down all day long and do nothing, let me remind you that in a post-rejuvenation world being 30 or being 90 makes no difference. You’re still healthy and energetic regardless of your age, so it’s unlikely all you’ll want to do after age 65 is twiddling your thumbs. 

I think I am maybe even less optimistic than the author about keeping people employed in meaningful work, in a kind of ""everything is as it's now, just for longer"" kind of projection.

These are factors that might distort the results of such a meta-study. This field is almost as problematic as pharmacology regarding reliability of studies.

,WhyYouAreVeryWrong,"&gt;  -They might want decreased government intervention in healthcare because they can't afford it.

Except for the part where they look at *every other western country*.  You don't have a single example of a country with less involvement in healthcare than the US having cheaper healthcare, but you have dozens of examples of countries with more government control of healthcare having cheaper prices.

The kids want what they see in Europe.

&gt; -They might want government out of the loan market because of the distortions it caused.

I agree on the distortions, but again, from a college student's perspective, *every European country has free or cheap college for citizens*, they look at that and want the same thing.


People often oversimplify things.  For example, Democrats who support a $15 minimum wage have *validly noticed legitimate problems with inequality* and declining pay for unskilled labor and increased abuse of unskilled workforce (retail jobs increasingly use abusive scheduling techniques, for example), and they're supporting the simplest-to-explain policy that sounds like it'll get them what they want.  *It's a stupid policy because economics don't work that way*, but it seems to catch in public eyes because it's simple to explain (""let's just make all the wages $15!"").  They see a genuine problem and demand the government fix it with a big stick.

(Democrats love stupid overly simple solutions that break more things, Republicans love to pretend the problem doesn't exist, politics is infuriating.)


A kid who comes out of college, sees his student debt, sees his healthcare costs, and struggles, isn't going to say ""I wish the government was doing less for me"".  He's going to go for the simplest answer- ""the government should do something""- and he can back that up further by looking at governments that *do* do something and say ""we should do that"".


----------------------

It doesn't help that conservatives have gotten 10x more conservative on economics.  Back in Nixon's era, and Eisenhower, Republicans had no problem with government legislation, they just wanted to avoid large bureaucracy and make conservative market-targeted approaches.  I wish we still had this.  Nixon started the EPA, expanded Medicare, and proposed a healthcare plan with a mandate that all employers offer health insurance and expansion of Medicaid (but liberals refused because they wanted something closer to single payer), Eisenhower aimed for a balanced budget, etc.  In a rational world, we'd have liberals arguing for regulating carbon output and conservatives arguing for a carbon tax that refunds the money raised directly to taxpayers to influence the market away from using carbon.  Instead, liberals go for extreme regulation while conservatives deny the problem because they are ideologically not allowed to accept any taxes.

I don't think colleges would be producing liberals so overwhelmingly if the Republican party today resembled Eisenhower/Nixon's economic views.  But they're so *anti-tax* and *anti-public-service* that it turns off urban people who *rely* on such services.  The parties have polarized and even people who don't like the identity/gender politics  will find conservative economics distasteful today.

----------------------

&gt; -We could argue that urban living shows them the wonders capitalism has produced for society that someone in a rural area wouldn't get to experience on as grand a scale.

This is reaching.  *Urban areas are overwhelmingly liberal.*  This is obviously not what happens.  People who live in urban areas increasingly rely on infrastructure created by shared pools of money (taxes) so tend to be okay with allowing it in their lives, while people in rural areas don't (or feel like they don't) so are averse to it.


&gt; There was a singular moment where a system that was once ideologically balanced hit a tipping point because a historical accident caused a brief shock. Over the next several decades the older right-wing people slowly retired one-by-one while not being replaced at the same rate since the changing environment was less and less appealing to their potential replacements at the margins.

Then explain why economists tend to be conservative?

Your ""liberals invaded academia because they were draft dodgers"" theory has nothing behind it but a feeling.  It's literally the exact same as the liberals who think conservatives deliberately invade economics teachers.

Urban liberals are more likely to go to college because it's more necessary to have educated jobs in an urban area.  Colleges are more likely to hire people with an education, which usually means those same urban liberals who went to the college.",1,1534445058,longevity

&gt; Full article here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22030953/

&gt; **Abstract**

&gt; Aging is commonly associated with a loss of muscle mass and strength, resulting in falls, functional decline, and the subjective feeling of weakness. Exercise modulates the morbidities of muscle aging. Most studies, however, have examined muscle-loss changes in sedentary aging adults. This leaves the question of whether the changes that are commonly associated with muscle aging reflect the true physiology of muscle aging or whether they reflect disuse atrophy. 

&gt; This study evaluated whether high levels of chronic exercise prevents the loss of lean muscle mass and strength experienced in sedentary aging adults. A cross-section of 40 high-level recreational athletes (""masters athletes"") who were aged 40 to 81 years and trained 4 to 5 times per week underwent tests of health/activity, body composition, quadriceps peak torque (PT), and magnetic resonance imaging of bilateral quadriceps. Mid-thigh muscle area, quadriceps area (QA), subcutaneous adipose tissue, and intramuscular adipose tissue were quantified in magnetic resonance imaging using medical image processing, analysis, and visualization software. One-way analysis of variance was used to examine age group differences. Relationships were evaluated using Spearman correlations. Mid-thigh muscle area (P = 0.31) and lean mass (P = 0.15) did not increase with age and were significantly related to retention of mid-thigh muscle area (P &lt; 0.0001). This occurred despite an increase in total body fat percentage (P = 0.003) with age. Mid-thigh muscle area (P = 0.12), QA (P = 0.17), and quadriceps PT did not decline with age. Specific strength (strength per QA) did not decline significantly with age (P = 0.06). As muscle area increased, PT increased significantly (P = 0.008). There was not a significant relationship between intramuscular adipose tissue (P = 0.71) or lean mass (P = 0.4) and PT. 

&gt; This study contradicts the common observation that muscle mass and strength decline as a function of aging alone. Instead, these declines may signal the effect of chronic disuse rather than muscle aging.

* A research team demonstrates the first senolytic drug candidates capable of selectively destroying senescent cells. The number of candidate drugs increases quite quickly after this point.
Pentraxin Therapeutics announces positive results in a trial of targeted clearance of transthyretin amyloid. Meanwhile, evidence continues to emerge from other groups for transthyretin amyloid to have more of an impact in age-related disease that previously thought.

* SENS Research Foundation work on sabotaging ALT to suppress cancer receives more attention. Meanwhile progress is reported on the other half of telomere extension blockade, interfering in the operation of telomerase, an area in which a number of groups are participating.

* The Methuselah Foundation makes a founding investment in Leucadia Therapeutics in order to pursue a novel approach to the effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
The research program producing catabodies capable of breaking down transthyretin amyloid is transferred to Covalent Bioscience for clinical development.

**2016**

* Ichor Therapeutics begins commercial development of a method of clearing metabolic waste from the retina, based on technology developed in the SENS Research Foundation LysoSENS program.

* Gensight Biologics demonstrates success in a trial of mitochondrial allotopic expression of ND4 as a way to treat inherited mutations of that gene. The underlying technology is proven. SENS Research Foundation scientists, meanwhile, successfully demonstrate allotopic expression of ATP6 and ATP8.

* After more than a decade of high profile failures, amyloid-β is finally cleared from the brain in a small human study using an immunotherapy approach.

* The SENS Research Foundation crowdfunds a drug discovery program to find candidates that can interfere in ALT, and thus suppress the telomere elongation that cancer depends upon.

* Cenexys is reformed as Unity Biotechnology with a focus on senolytic drugs. The researchers involved show that clearance of senescent cells in normal mice produces 25% extension of median life span. Later in 2016, the company raises $116M in venture funding.

* Other work on removal of senescent cells across the year shows restoration of function in aged lung tissue, and improved vascular health. New evidence reinforces the role of senescent cells in osteoarthritis, as well as in atherosclerosis, immunosenescence, and diabetic retinopathy

* The Methuselah Foundation launches a $500,000 research prize for tissue engineering in collaboration with NASA.

* Michael Greve pledges $10M to fund SENS research and startup biotechnology companies that emerge from that research.

,Erebopsilva,"Well, as I've said to some other comment, I don't try at any time, to speak for anyone but me... All my post is just a personal view (much badly expressed than I thought). I would never impose my view to anyone, and I very much agree with:

&gt;As the decision to end one's life SHOULD be up to the individual, so  should the length of life be, if the means to make that happen are  available. If you don't want it, don't do it. Those who find the idea of  living longer preferable shouldn't be restricted by those who don't,  and vice versa.

Also this is basically what I was trying to say:

&gt;That said, if all we got was good health  until 90, that would be preferable to the CURRENT situation of a slow  decline from 65ish and up.

And really I agree with most of your response, actually... About the limit, I said it already in other comment, I don't use it as something that should not be pushed, but as something that is (as always in my opinion) much harder to move than other limits that we have already surpassed.

TL;DR: Personal opinions aside, all I was trying to say could be presented as you say:

&gt;But most logical and sane people don't expect actual immortality. Just a longer, disease and suffering free life.

Thanks.",1,1533089172,longevity
,Erebopsilva,"Yes. I was trying to say that research facilities don't aim to immortality, but of course both life and health span are desirable results...

I've tried to further explain my intentions behind that 90 years old healthy thing (probably not entirely successfully).",1,1533087928,longevity
,Erebopsilva,"I can't disagree with that, in a way health causes longevity. But there are more factors. After all, death is the result of several molecular mechanisms that gradually malfunction. That causes the general deterioration in the body. When I say ""heath"" I probably should have said ""healthier"". I mean to have the vitality of a current 60 years old while being 90. For instance. The numbers are an example. 

The matter on why would people could want or not, is, as you say, merely phylosophical I guess.

On the last point, all I try to say (probably not the best way), is that the idea of Immortality is ridiculous for me. Life expectancy extension, on the other hand, is most likely to be enhanced in that time lapse (15-20 years)... I'm confident about it. So, while I know for sure that life extension is being pursued in this field, I just doubt that immortality is a realistic goal.",2,1533086599,longevity
,Ham686,"I don't think a differing opinion (I don't mean this in a snippy way, despite how it will probably read; we're all strangers here) from a nameless and faceless researcher on reddit that goes against what the rest of the echo chamber wants to hear is the problem. In this case, it's probably more that you're kind of speaking for society and everyone involved about what is preferable or desirable based on what you personally want. 

&gt;Not only I find it unlikely to reach immortality (soon or at all), I find it undesirable.

As the decision to end one's life SHOULD be up to the individual, so should the length of life be, if the means to make that happen are available. If you don't want it, don't do it. Those who find the idea of living longer preferable shouldn't be restricted by those who don't, and vice versa.

But there is nothing preferable about dying at 90 in 'full-shape', whatever that means. And it's disingenuous at best to suggest that would be the case. After all, most healthy people just don't drop dead... and if people are able to actually be healthy at age 90, I can't imagine why that wouldn't hold true. That said, if all we got was good health until 90, that would be preferable to the CURRENT situation of a slow decline from 65ish and up. 

&gt;We, as a society, should aim to prolong the wellness and vitality for as long as we live, not to prolong life itself beyond its limits

This here is a pretty egregious mindset though. This is nothing more than an arbitrary appeal to nature. And it also completely disregards the idea that if you've preserved wellness and vitality, that you're probably not going to magically drop dead. But what is the limit? 80? 90? 122? I mean the maximum known length of life has been 122, which occurred naturally, but most people in the industrialized world can only expect ~80. Where's the line here? Humanity has pushed past 'limits' in pretty much every aspect of life from the beginning. After all, if we didn't break limits, we'd still be in a cave banging rocks together, suffering from smallpox or typhoid and dying at 30. If we were complacent and didn't push past limits, we definitely wouldn't be living in climate controlled dwellings with the ability to travel across the world in under a day. There's not much about the modern lifestyle that's 'natural'.

&gt;An extension of the current life expectancy is, however, achievable, and in 15 to 20 years we'll probably had extend already it in some years. Immortality are major words, tho.

Yeah, maybe. But most logical and sane people don't expect actual immortality. Just a longer, disease and suffering free life.

,Anle-,"To introduce yourself to the topic from the perspective of biology you might want to start by reading [Ending Aging](https://smile.amazon.com/Ending-Aging-Rejuvenation-Breakthroughs-Lifetime-ebook/dp/B001ANSSKA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1531856603&amp;sr=8-1), by Aubrey de Grey. Here [one of the TED Talks](https://youtu.be/AvWtSUdOWVI) of the author.

In short, what changed is that starting from the early 2000s a well defined strategy to put aging under medical control (reversing it) emerged, by recognising [what aging is](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2813%2900645-4) and how medicine could target all of its facets (the ""damages"" or ""hallmarks"" of aging Aubrey de Grey and the paper linked above talk about). In more recent years this promising approach is gaining more and more momentum, in the form, for example, of [human trials for senescent cells removal](http://ir.unitybiotechnology.com/news-releases/news-release-details/unity-biotechnology-inc-announces-first-patient-treated-ubx0101) (senescent cells are one of the hallmarks/damages), experiments rejuvenating mice, or the foundation of several new companies. Here [a map of progress ](https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/)that helps you watch the progression of relevant therapies in this field from early basic research to human clinical trials, and [monthly and yearly roundups](https://www.leafscience.org/?s=rejuvenation+roundup) keeping up with what's happening.

15-20 years is probably an optimistic timeframe that assumes optimal funding and no major roadblocks, but working all together, doing advocacy and [donating to research](http://www.sens.org/donate) we might put aging under medical control in most people's alive today lifetimes. These short timeframe predictions rely on a concept called Longevity Escape Velocity: even if the first therapies will be imperfect they will probably buy enough time for people to be alive when the next generation of more perfected therapies will be avalable, and so on till aging is completely reversible. The evidence in favour of this is taken from the history of technology: Each subsequent improvement on an existing technology always takes far less time that the first development made by the pioneers. This happens due to the ideas behind the technology becoming accepted and understood, research becoming worldwide and funding flawing at optimal rate after the feasibility becomes evident. It's argued that that this first ""proof of concept"" required to convince the world is [Robust Mouse Rejuvenation](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2014/04/what-is-robust-mouse-rejuvenation-and-why-should-we-care/): doubling the remaining [life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) of elderly mice, demonstrated and then replicated in rigorous laboratory studies. It also helps that the various facets of aging are all interacting with each other and improving one aspect should have a cascade of positive effects on the other aspects.

Regardless of the timeframe, speeding up the progress of this field is a moral imperative for many, since aging is the biggest killer on the planet, responsible for 2/3 of all deaths and countless years of suffering due to late life disability and ill health. 100000 deaths due to aging out of 150000 total deaths happen each day, amounting to more than one person per second dying because of aging.

""Immortality"" in the sense of  ""invulnerability"" or ""infinite life"", on the contrary, is more difficult to achieve and it may never arrive for anyone, since even after putting aging under medical control there will still be accidents and maybe infectious diseases, although probably decreasing with time given current trends. This is why in this sub we generally don't like talking in terms of ""immortality"", together with the fact that it tends to give off a bad impression when trying to educate people on the topic.

The closest thing to discussing a macronutrient ratio is pointing to the traditional Okinawa diet.

,MaximilianKohler,"Abstract

The gut microbiota shows a wide inter-individual variation, but its within-individual variation is relatively stable over time. A functional core microbiome, provided by abundant bacterial taxa, seems to be common to various human hosts regardless of their gender, geographic location, and age. With advancing chronological age, the gut microbiota becomes more diverse and variable. However, when measures of biological age are used with adjustment for chronological age, overall richness decreases, while a certain group of bacteria associated with frailty increases. This highlights the importance of considering biological or functional measures of aging. Studies using model organisms indicate that age-related gut dysbiosis may contribute to unhealthy aging and reduced longevity. The gut microbiome depends on the host nutrient signaling pathways for its beneficial effects on host health and lifespan, and gut dysbiosis disrupting the interdependence may diminish the beneficial effects or even have reverse effects. Gut dysbiosis can trigger the innate immune response and chronic low-grade inflammation, leading to many age-related degenerative pathologies and unhealthy aging. The gut microbiota communicates with the host through various biomolecules, nutrient signaling-independent pathways, and epigenetic mechanisms. Disturbance of these communications by age-related gut dysbiosis can affect the host health and lifespan. This may explain the impact of the gut microbiome on health and aging.",3,1532264244,longevity
,1345834,"check this comment on r/vegan, by a vegan: https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/zz7wb/debunking_resources/c6bky0m/

&gt;Unfortunately, the reason why more people don't rebut these kinds of things is because it takes time and effort to do so, and this sadly requires funding to accomplish if you're not independently wealthy. As a decidedly not independently wealthy person, I simply do not have the free time available to replicate reviews that have already been done multiple times. If I were to do such a review, it might convince those that know me, my character, and my attention to detail; but honestly, no one else would listen. It would just be yet another critique of the China Study, and there are all too many of those already.

&gt;As a short list, here are a few peer-reviewed articles specifically attacking claims made in the China Study (which, by the way, is itself not peer-reviewed):

&gt;- Claim 1: ""[Protein from dairy products] almost certainly contribute to a significant loss of bone calcium while vegetable-based diets clearly protect against bone loss"". *—Campbell in 1994 article in Cornell Chronicle
- Debunking of 1: ""The results strongly indicated that dietary calcium, especially from dairy sources, increased bone mass …. [C]alcium from dairy sources was correlated with bone variables to a higher degree than was calcium from the nondairy sources"". —Campbell in Dietary calcium and bone density
- Claim 2: ""[Due to animal consumption raising cholesterol,] the findings from the China Study indicate that the lower the percentage of animal-based foods that are consumed, the greater the health benefits. "" —Campbell on p242 of The China Study
- Claim 3: ""Plasma cholesterol is positively associated with animal protein intake and inversely associated with plant protein intake."" —Campbell in 2001 article in Cornell Chronicle
- Debunking of 2 &amp; 3: ""Within China neither plasma total cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol was associated with CVD. … The results indicate that geographical differences in CVD mortality within China are caused primarily by factors other than dietary or plasma cholesterol. … There were no significant correlations between the various cholesterol fractions and the three mortality rates."" —Campbell in Erythrocyte fatty acids, plasma lipids, and cardiovascular disease in rural China
- Claim 4: ""Liver cancer is strongly associated with increasing blood cholesterol."" —Campbell on p104 of The China Study
- Debunking of 4: ""This produces…an inverse relation between cholesterol concentration and the risk of death from liver cancer or from other chronic liver disease."" —Campbell in Prolonged infection with hepatitis B virus and association between low blood cholesterol concentration and liver cancer
- Claim 5: ""[A]s blood cholesterol levels in rural China rose in certain counties the incidence of 'Western' diseases also increased"". —Campbell on p78 of The China Study
- Debunking of 5: ""[I]t is the largely vegetarian, inland communities who have the greatest all risk mortalities and morbidities and who have the lowest LDL cholesterols"". —Campbell in Fish consumption, blood docosahexaenoic acid and chronic diseases in Chinese rural populations

&gt;For fun, notice that every single debunking article I mentioned above is from T. Colin Campbell himself. Yes, seriously. He actually rebuts his own points when submitting peer reviewed articles. I guess he's more careful with what he says when he's not writing a book aimed at the general public to help convince people to go vegan.

&gt;I wish I could do more than show you why so many claims made in the China Study are false. But I only have the time available to cite articles, as I did above. Hopefully you will take these rebuttals seriously, since Campbell himself wrote them. (Too bad he refuses to update his China Study book appropriately.)

&gt;For the larger question of whether vegan food is more healthy for humans, I should note that it is fairly proven to be at least as good as eating meat, and there are several positive correlations with eating less of specific types of meat. Thats why Pollan's ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" mantra is the best recommendation I know of when it comes to health. But a strict recommendation to be vegan for health reasons just does not seem scientific at this point.

&gt;Nevertheless, I continue to not eat meat, and I highly recommend others to fully abandon meat for ethical reasons. The health issue just doesn't have a strong enough case for it yet. (Hell, even limiting your salt intake doesn't have a good enough case to convince me to dramatically limit my salt consumption, even though there is really good science that eating 1/10 the salt I do today would be a huge benefit health-wise -- much more than even Campbell claims of veganism in the China Study. I just like salt too damn much. For most rational people, the same reasoning applies to meat. Hence my focus on ethical arguments for veganism.)

* Ichor Therapeutics begins commercial development of a method of clearing metabolic waste from the retina, based on technology developed in the SENS Research Foundation LysoSENS program.

* Gensight Biologics demonstrates success in a trial of mitochondrial allotopic expression of ND4 as a way to treat inherited mutations of that gene. The underlying technology is proven. SENS Research Foundation scientists, meanwhile, successfully demonstrate allotopic expression of ATP6 and ATP8.

* After more than a decade of high profile failures, amyloid-β is finally cleared from the brain in a small human study using an immunotherapy approach.

* The SENS Research Foundation crowdfunds a drug discovery program to find candidates that can interfere in ALT, and thus suppress the telomere elongation that cancer depends upon.

* Cenexys is reformed as Unity Biotechnology with a focus on senolytic drugs. The researchers involved show that clearance of senescent cells in normal mice produces 25% extension of median life span. Later in 2016, the company raises $116M in venture funding.

* Other work on removal of senescent cells across the year shows restoration of function in aged lung tissue, and improved vascular health. New evidence reinforces the role of senescent cells in osteoarthritis, as well as in atherosclerosis, immunosenescence, and diabetic retinopathy

* The Methuselah Foundation launches a $500,000 research prize for tissue engineering in collaboration with NASA.

* Michael Greve pledges $10M to fund SENS research and startup biotechnology companies that emerge from that research.
2017

* There are now nearing ten different senolytic drug candidates with openly published evidence, and more in the pipeline.

* Oisin Biotechnologies announces that their senescent cell clearance technology can also be applied to cancerous cells, reporting successful animal studies for tumor ablation.

* Methuselah Foundation launches the Methuselah Fund to shepherd more rejuvenation-related biotechnology startups towards success. The first funded company under this new organizational umbrella is Leucadia Therapeutics, working on a way to restore natural drainage channels for cerebrospinal fluid that fail with age. This is expected to help reduce the buildup of harmful metabolic waste in the brain.

* Betterhumans, associated with the Society for the Rescue of our Elders, begins running small human pilot trials of senolytic drug candidates.

* Noted investor Jim Mellon declares aging as his next target, offers support for SENS approaches in his book Juvenescence, and begins investing in companies working on means to treat aging.
The Pineapple Fund and Vitalik Buterin donate $4.4 million in cryptocurrency to the SENS Research Foundation.

**2018**

* The influential Y Combinator venture firm launches YC Bio, aimed squarely at funding startups working on the treatment of aging. There are now at least five venture funds dedicated to investing in startups that work on the treatment of aging as a medical condition. Laura Deming expands the size her Longevity Fund and launches the Age1 incubator for companies working on aging.

* Unity Biotechnology has by mid-2018 raised an enormous amount of money, filed for IPO, and while clarifying some of the senolytic targets they are developing, has yet to report human trial results.

* Gensight Biologics is conducting phase III trials for allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes to treat inherited blindness conditions. One of the trials fails on a technicality while producing better than anticipated gain in vision for patients. That allotopic expression can work is well demonstrated by now.

* Reason launches the Repair Biotechnologies startup to work on projects in rejuvenation research.
Cleara Biotech is founded to develop the FOXO4-DRI approach to clearing senescent cells as a therapy.

,McCapnHammerTime,"Having muscle is important, strength is a good indicator of overall health and longevity especially as you get older. That being said high protein consumption triggers mTOR and raises IGF-1 levels. Both of these will negatively impact your longevity. Metformin and Rapamycin are two drugs that have shown pretty good efficacy in promoting longevity both of which inhibit mTOR signaling. I think one of the important things to take away from this is how to strike a good balance between retaining muscle as you age and not spilling over into too much GH and mTOR signaling. I think intermittent fasting will help in these cases as your meal timing will allow for much more pulsatile rises in those growth factors and signaling pathways. 

Another aspect of longevity that you would be able to manipulate much easier if you want to be competitive in the fitness world and or achieve your own body/strength goals would be to just manage your inflammation the best you can. Optimizing digestion, including anti-inflammatory foods and spices in your diet will be much more noticeable as far as health impact then hyper focusing on mTOR and protein macros.

,Mitohormesis,"That protocol is not extreme and is sensible from that regard (when compared to fasting protocols being used in various clinics around the world). Providing you have no serious health conditions and aren’t severely under weight the risk of such a protocol should be low.

Some advocates that I’ve seen promoting extended fasts of the (extreme) duration of months, at which point loss of muscle mass, extended vitamin and mineral deficiencies come into question (triage theory), reduced sleep quality etc... there is a very serious concern of risk.

Would highly recommend looking into Longos research papers, his recent podcast with Rhonda Patrick highlighted some gems. That the results from the fasting mimicking diet or short interval water fasting normalised biomarkers to healthy ranges, where as extended caloric restriction (or long term extreme fasting) would go beyond this modulation and could them to unhealthy ranges (say too low blood sugar, cholesterol etc...).

Also this normalisation of the patients biomarkers faded over time which is why the protocol should be repeated.

The patients fitness would also vary the frequency at which it should be repeated, with a higher fitness level requiring perhaps 3 times a year where as a patient that is more compromised could need it every couple of months.

One way to test this would be to measure the set of biomarkers you are monitoring before and after the protocol, then checking at intervals after this to see the rate of decline in the improvements. You could then determine a reasonable delta to repeat the protocol to keep your biomarkers within a certain range.

I’d also suspect as fitness is correlated with age to a certain degree, over time the protocol would need to be increased in frequency.",2,1531527554,longevity

DOI: [10.1126/scitranslmed.aaq1564](http://sci-hub.bz/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaq1564)  
   
The objective of this ***phase 2a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical*** trial was to determine whether low-dose mTOR inhibitor therapy enhanced immune function and decreased infection rates in ***264 elderly subjects*** given the study drugs for ***6 weeks.***  
   
**A low-dose combination of a catalytic (BEZ235 \[=RTB101\]) plus an allosteric (RAD001 \[=everolimus\]**) mTOR inhibitor that selectively inhibits target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) downstream of mTOR **was safe** and was associated with a significant (*P* = 0.001) ***decrease in the rate of infections*** reported by elderly subjects ***for a year after study drug initiation***. In addition, we observed an up-regulation of antiviral gene expression and an *improvement in the response to influenza vaccination* in this treatment group.

In the ***RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101+everolimus*** combination treatment arms, statistically significant and clinically meaningful ***reductions in the annual rate of infections of 33\% (p=0.008) and 38\% (p=0.001), respectively***, compared to placebo, were observed. In addition, both RTB101 monotherapy and the RTB101+everolimus combination therapy were observed to ***reduce the incidence of \[respiratory tract infections (RTIs)\] at one year by 42\% (p=0.006) and 36\% (p=0.01), respectively***. \[MR: It looks to me like combination therapy is a wash vs. everolimus alone\]. The combination of RTB101+everolimus was also observed to significantly enhance the response to influenza vaccination and upregulated the expression of critical antiviral genes that play a key role in enabling the immune system to protect the elderly from respiratory tract infections.  
   
RTIs are the fourth leading cause of hospitalizations and the seventh leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older in the United States. Moreover, the majority of RTIs in the elderly are caused by viruses for which there are currently no approved therapies. resTORbio’s TORC1 inhibitor program has the potential, if successfully developed and approved, to be a new class of immunotherapy that enhances the function of the aging immune system to fight infectious pathogens including viruses, and thereby reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections.  
   
Based on the results of the Phase 2a study, ***resTORbio is conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial to further investigate the potential benefits of RTB101 alone and in combination with everolimus in aging-related diseases.*** In the ongoing Phase 2b study, doses of RTB101 alone and in combination with everolimus are being evaluated as an immunotherapy to decrease the incidence of RTIs ***in older people at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from RTI***s (defined as age 85 and older and age 65 and older with comorbidities). ***Dosing has been completed*** in the Phase 2b study and 16-week topline data are expected to be reported in the third quarter of 2018.

... After a year, the study subjects who got the two-drug combination reported 1.49 infections, such as colds and bronchitis, the researchers report. Those who took the placebo reported 2.41 infections. That works out to be about a 40 percent reduction.  
   
""That's a big reduction,"" Mannick says. \[MR: on a relative basis, yes — but it's a small absolute effect in a small number of subjects in each arm\].  
The drugs also boosted how the elderly study subjects' immune systems responded to a flu vaccine — increasing the levels of flu antibodies their immune systems produced by more than 20 percent, Mannick says. ...  
   
The researchers stress that more research is needed to confirm the findings and show the drugs are safe.

""History and characteristics of Okinawan longevity food""

Hiroko Sho Director
University of The Air Okinawa Study Center, Okinawa, Japan

Okinawan food culture in the Ryukyu island is one of the world’s most interesting culture because its consumers have the longest life expectancies and low disability rates. It is a product of cultural synthesis, with a core of Chinese food culture, inputs through food trade with South-East Asia and the Pacific and strong Japanese influences in eating style and presentation. The Satsamu sweet potato provides the largest part of the energy intake (and contributes to self-sufficiency), there is a wide array of plant foods including seaweed (especially konbu) and soy, and of herbaceous plants, accompanied by fish and pork, and by green tea and kohencha tea. Infusing multiple foodstuff and drinking the broth is characteristic. Raw sugar is eaten. The concept that ‘food is medicine’ and a high regard accorded medical practice are also intrinsic of Okinawan culture. Again, food- centered and ancestral festivities keeep the health dimensions well-developed. Pork, konbu and tofu (soy bean- curd) are indispensable ingredients in festival menus, and the combination of tofu and seaweed are used everyday. Okinawan food culture is intimately linked with an enduring belief of the system and highly developed social structure and network.

,Aetrion,"This is absolute nonsense. 

First of all, being able to extend lifespan doesn't mean you have to live forever, in a post aging society there would probably be a formal way to wrap up your affairs and end your life if you so desire. Science isn't promising eternal life anyways, because we'd have to change the laws of the universe for that, and hey, maybe if we're still around in billions of years we can get on that, but for right now it'd just be nice to have more than 30 years of great health.   

Secondly, nobody has any idea what would compel a thousand year old person, or a ten thousand year old person, or even a hundred year old person who's still in a healthy body. We just don't know if living that long is desirable, and we will not find out unless we go there.

Thirdly, it's entirely possible that beings without a finite natural lifespan will not have a single continuous memory of their existence. Maybe you wouldn't be able to remember what you were like a thousand years ago, or only be able to remember it the same way you remember a history book, but that doesn't mean your existence in that moment is irrelevant or undesirable. Billions of people find meaning in life knowing that they will eventually die, so why would they find less meaning knowing that they will eventually forget?

Furthermore, the notion that nothing stays the same and therefore our lives are defined by losing things is only half the picture, because new things are also created all the time. The problem isn't that the world you were born into will disappear, the problem is that aging takes away your ability to tackle the new one with the energy you had in the world you were born into. Yes, we're on a continuous journey through time, and you can't stay in one place, but that's not the problem, the problem is that at some point you're too old to keep walking.",19,1531117680,longevity

,BlueberryPhi,"I doubt it, because of why aging evolved in the first place.

Our bodies age because the mechanisms for repairing them only have to last as long as our lives would in the wild, before we get killed or succumb to disease or injury or starvation.  That's why different species have different health issues tied to aging.

Right now, we're able to live long enough that we see the beginnings of the limits of our current mechanisms.  But if we fix those problems with the mechanisms that break down now, we'll be able to live until another of our mechanisms begins to finally break down enough that it becomes a problem.  Because it would be a different mechanism, the cure for it would be different.

The TRICK is to get research focused enough on anti-aging technology that we eventually become able to repair the mechanism breakdowns very shortly after discovering them, pushing the maximum age out further and further, until the average rate at which we push it out becomes faster than the rate at which we age.",5,1530609363,longevity
,Satisfying_,"I'm not a time traveler man, so I wouldn't know lol. I don't exactly know what you mean by ""anti-aging tech"" but we already have many different ways to prolong our lives/hide signs of aging. There are two paths to promoting longevity - the body and the mind. We often see older people with good, mostly healthy bodies dying due to mental illness. And then we see people with healthy minds dying due to physical ailments, ex. vital organs (my grandparents for example, dying around 100 who could still crack jokes and have a conversation with me).

I don't know too much about the human body, as I prefer learning about our minds. When it comes to our brains, NMDA antagonists interest me a lot (ex. Ketamine). There is a very high % of a ketamine injection ridding a human of major depression (which often leads to worse mental illnesses). It essentially stops important cells and I believe neuron pathways from dying. You should look into it. If we can control what our brain does, ex. decreasing adrenaline usage for non-physical events, thus lowering our heart's heavy workload, we can prolong its health (clonidine and beta-blockers like propanalol can accomplish this).",1,1530515123,longevity

There's a matter of reaching longevity escape velocity where you do your best to improve your lifestyle habits for maximum longevity while biotech progresses and keeps you younger than you would be while things simultaneously improve. This is just health though. You'll want to be careful elsewhere too.

,LarsHoldgaard,"Well, assuming you're from a top 10&amp;#37; country in terms of longevity, you can \*roughly\* assume 80 years. You're born in \~2004, so without any improvements you can expect to live to 2084.  


Say you lived in one of the most healthy areas - ie Monaco, Hong Kong or some of the ""blue zones"" - you could push it closer to 85/90 years. Now you're up to 2089-2094.

But wait, it gets better. Say you're extreme in your longevity and apply the best techniques (everything from fasting, regular checks, exercise...), I wouldn't be surprised you can push your average life expectancy to 95. Now we're not talking average healthy, but taking it to extremes. I haven't seen any numbers for this, but wouldn't be surprised that if you combine all todays knowledge, could you get up there. Now we're getting close to 2100.

BUT WAIT, it gets even better. For the richest population in the US, the average life expectancy has increased 0.2 years per year since year 2000 (2000 - 2015). Assume this continues, over 50 years this is 10 extra years. Now, this is probably a mix of our extreme measures from before being more widely available + but also just better general health care, medicine and options.

Above is all real numbers &amp; realistic - so the answer is ""pretty good if you take longevity seriously"".

Now, the real hope many of us in /r/longevity have, is to take it a biiiiit further. We hope we will hit the ""longevity escape velocity"", meaning that every year that goes by, we can add at least one year per year, meaning life expectancy increases.

Now, I haven't seen any numbers that suggest that life expectancy is exponentially growing. However, with technology improvements in AI, biotech, nanotech and so forth? Who knows.

Ah I see what your alluding to here so, so personalised gene therapy that can be both tissue specific and match the desired methylation pattern on the CpG sites, to provide you with a health promoting genotype? I guess the adjunct to this would be the insertion of new genes or removal and modification then subsequent reinsertion, although that is arguably more experimental, since this is no longer dealing with the epigenetic layer.

,TyeJensen,"As u/cuteman mentioned, microbiome maintenance is a long-term and multi-factorial task. The forest analogy is spot on and it is important to understand that there are many species of microorganisms living in the gut, all vying for territory. To establish and maintain a healthy microbiome (which is different for each person) requires 1) introducing and supporting diversity, 2) applying negative pressures on the growth of pathogenic species, and 3) applying positive pressure on the growth of beneficial bacteria.

Lifestyle (nutrition, stress management, exercise, and sleep) has the largest regulatory role on the health of your microbiome, so that is the obvious place to start and others in this thread have covered the basics of nutrition. Stress management is important as the microbiome and immune system have a deep relationship; either out of balance negatively impacts the other. Exercise increases diversity but over-training can also negatively impact the gut. 

Circling back to your question, probiotic (aka fermented foods) tend to be clinically beneficial in certain conditions and increase the diversity of the microbiome in otherwise healthy individuals; however, these foods and most OTC probiotic supplements seem to only impact the transient bacteria, representing 5-10&amp;#37; of the microbiome. So, if you have a ""healthy"" microbiome, it's much easier to maintain/improve simply by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working probiotic and prebiotic-fiber-containing foods into your daily and weekly nutrition.

However, correcting any sort of dysbiosis that extends in to the non-transient portions of the microbiome (90&amp;#37;+) tends to be more harder as colonized bacteria, beneficial or pathogenic, are harder to shift. I'm working on a microbiome reset protocol that requires first removing (killing) pathogenic bacteria and other microorganisms -- especially those in biofilms -- and then repopulating the gut with diverse, beneficial species through supplementation and lifestyle modification over a 1 month period.

In this analytical observational study, we evaluated the relationship between environment factors, oxidative stress status, DNA integrity level, and the association of FOXO3 (rs2802292), SOD2 (rs4880), APOE (rs429358 and rs7412), and SIRT1 (rs2273773) polymorphisms with longevity in oldest-old individuals from southeastern Brazil. We found an association between the FOXO3 GG genotype and gender. While lifestyle, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics showed significant results, DNA damage and oxidative stress were not related to lifespan. We found that long-lived individuals with FOXO3 GT genotype had low levels of triglycerides. This study is the first to demonstrate that FOXO3 could be a candidate gene for longevity in the Brazilian population. These results are important in terms of provisions of health care for age-related diseases and lifespan, and provide insight for further research on epigenetic, gene regulation, and expression in oldest-old individuals.

,mahoski,"I'm a computer scientist and also a nerd in a general sense, I've got to admit. I love learning new things, especially gaining knowledge in science and tech-related areas.

My rough estimate is that in order to learn everything I want to learn today, as if everything that exists as established knowledge currently, would take me about 2000 years. Sounds a bit silly, I know, but hear me out:

- Theoretical computer science, formal automata, formal languages, cutting-edge computer science math mastery - 50-100 years.

- Mastery in everything that currently exists in the fields of machine learning and AI research - 200 years.

- Mastery in web development using ASP.NET, PHP/WordPress and a few Javascript-based frameworks, as well as realizing a few projects that I currently have as ideas, using those technologies - 100 years.

- Mastery (as if the current cutting-edge research level) in the areas of mathematics that interest me the most: calculus, discrete mathematics, probability and statistics - anywhere from 200 to 500 years.

- Mastery in physics concepts that are currently cutting-edge, like string theory and quantum loop gravity (these imply mastery in general relativity and quantum mechanics beforehand) - 200 years.

... This goes on for a few other things that I would like to know, as completely as possible, and I mean top-level cutting-edge scientist level of knowledge and beyond.

Note that the estimates above are for the knowledge that exists TODAY. How much new knowledge will exist by the time I am finished? A conservative estimate is ten times the amount that would exist the moment I started.

Okay, even though I love gaining tech and science-related knowledge, that's not all I wanna do. I love:

- Fitness/bodybuilding. I love the process of trying to get to the best possible form of the human body, or at least realizing your full potential, your best appearance allowed by your genetics. I would be able to dedicate a few decades to extremely fitness and health-focused lifestyle, a period in which that would be my top priority.

- Martial arts. I have a black belt in karate, but unfortunately I have abandoned it because of my university (had to move to another city). I would love to have a chance to master it as much as possible or as far as I would like to go. I would also like to learn ninjitsu, aikido, kendo and taekwondo.

- Photography. Mobile, DSLRs, computational photography, post-processing with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, etc.

- Gadening. I love planting interesting kinds of plants, cultivating them, watching them grow and taking photos of the progress.

- Playing video games (I don't play any currently because I don't have time and each time I'm tempted I say life is too short to be wasted doing that). I love playing MMORPGs the most, which are extremely time-consuming and I can dedicate a few current lifetimes just to that, given the opportunity.

- Reading fantasy novels. Tolkien (LotR), GRRM (ASoIaF), The Wheel of Time, etc. All of these are complex universes that also come with a lot of supplemental material, rich communities that discuss them and engage in creating artwork and theory-crafting.

,ptword,"Sounds right in principle, but, putting all the dubious correlations aside, there are a couple of issues:

1. This doesn't necessarily benefit the most hard-working, competent, innovative individuals because someone's net contribution to the overall economy and society is also dependent on the health of these macroenvironments and the opportunities that are given to them. You'd possibly be missing out on a lot.

2. Contribution to society might be negative at one point, but it's only fair to hold this against someone if everyone is given the same opportunities. If you judge net contribution at a single point in time to determine who can and who cannot live longer from then on, you're not giving everyone the same opportunities to prove themselves over time. Not fair. Some people might simply find a way to thrive later than others if given proper incentives/opportunities. Plus, there's no way to know that those who have contributed positively until then will continue to do so indefinitely with an extended lifespan. Extended lifespans could make everyone equally likely to stagnate eventually.

3. Even if there was a casual relationship between net contribution to society and competence, character, or any other arbitrary criteria you choose to include here to determine ""value"", it wouldn't stop the ""low value"" people from reproducing and perpetuating economic and social liabilities over and over again... so you're basically speaking of arbitrary genocide or eugenics if you were to truly erradicate society from these individuals. Putting all the moral issues aside, we're talking about a pretty large percentage of the human population, so the evolutionary consequences are pretty scary to think about. Reducing the genetic pool in such a way doesn't sound like a good idea at all. In fact, life extension itself could also be detrimental to our genetic evolution, but this is another discussion.

- Although not discussed in this post, some recent societies thrived on animal-based diets with little and infrequent plant intake.
- β-hydroxybutyrate triggers many of the same mechanisms that butyrate does; those very mechanisms thought to explain its role in preventing colon cancer and the intestinal degradation seen in diseased colons or the colons of those receiving reduced fibre diets to promote bowel rest.
- β-hydroxybutyrate may even be the pathway through which butyrate exerts its beneficial effects, given that it is a direct metabolite of butyrate, and that systemic butyrate appears to be as effective or even more effective in treating colitis, than direct application of butyrate to the cells.
- Even without eating fibre, our intestinal microbes produce butyrate from amino acids. If systemic ketone bodies supplant or even just reduce the need for butyrate, amino acid derived butyrate may supply this need, even if the quantities turn out to be less than we would get from fibre.

on the topic of microbiome. I have heard people smarter than me argue that the biome research while super interesting is still early days and that there is great uncertainty as what constitutes a ""good"" microbiome and how to effect it. for an example wethere bacteria X is good for a person con depend on if it was precent at an early age. Think the idea the at diverse microbiome is good is based on a single study. 

heres the result of one guy doing carnivore and testing the biome
https://www.onnit.com/academy/the-carnivore-diet/
&gt;“I had zero dysbiotic flora [the bad bacteria] at the end of the diet,” says Munsey, who had his poo tested. “And I had pretty good numbers on all the beneficial flora.” He chalks it up to the carnivore diet being, if nothing else, an extreme elimination diet that starves sugar-hungry bad bacteria to death. “Yeah, it would starve some of the good ones as well, but maybe we don’t need as many of those. Maybe we only need them if we’re eating a high-plant diet. It’s never been studied, so for people to jump right out and say the carnivore diet is wrong and bad for your health… well, we don’t know that.”

,Mitohormesis,"Intriguing indeed, it does seem plausible that a leaky gut could lead to immune regulation issues, due to unwanted particles reaching the blood stream causing an immune response. I'd need to dig deeper, but if it's corrected intestinal permeability issues it could be a potential tool to fix a condition.

The diet shouldn't really be called paleo keto since it's essentially the carnivore diet, where as paleo and/or keto is far more broad. I would have concern on the diet over the long term though (years). It does not overlap significantly with any blue zone diet.

In general I'm not an advocate of processed meat consumption but saying that you could run this diet without consumption of these products.

Animal products are high in advance glycation end-products (AGEs) and high temperature cooking doubles the formation of AGEs and can produce heterocyclic &amp; polycyclic amines. Which will be of more concern if your diet is abundant in this. [Diets low in AGEs have been shown to have a health promoting effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5442099/). But cooking methods could help mitigate this somewhat.

The large meat consumption would likely lead to a [gut biome shift increasing the production of TMAO](http://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2015/09/03/gutjnl-2015-309957?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GUT_TrendMD-%25SPONSORED%25). Which is a debatable concern for atherosclerosis.

The lack of other foodstuffs would over the long term put biome diversity at risk which is becoming of emerging importance. For example [biome diversity has been linked to less weight gain over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201766).

But of more concern to me would be the lack of fiber, which has been shown to [lower all cause mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552267). The reduction in fermentable fiber would also mean a reduction in butyrate production, which is of even more importance when larger amounts of red or process meat is being consumed to [protect against bowel cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24160296) risk factors.

This lack of fermentable (prebiotic) fiber would also lead to a reduction in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the intestine, which could be vital for the [protection against atherosclerosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5517538/). Along this vein the reduction SCFA production would be the starving of the [goblet cells which thrive on SCFA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300962995000334) which produce the mucin which is integral for the intestinal mucosal barrier.

This is separate from the potential blood lipid changes over the long term which could be of concern, I personally for example have a genotype (various SNPs) which mean that my saturated fat intake should be low relative to my mono &amp; poly unsaturated fat intake.

A broad dietary rule to remove all polyphenols does seem extreme or even detrimental.

The more radical the food group restriction or dietary change the more importance there is to monitor biomarkers (a vegan &amp; carnivore diet I would put in this category, of course for very different reasons). I'd be curious to see the blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, microbiome analysis and weight fluctuations over a few years of someone who adheres to such a diet.",4,1528629653,longevity

IANAD but I've done pretty well considering my family history and genetics (clean bill of cardio health aside from some very mild atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta) sticking to a pretty strict fish-and-vegetable-centric diet (not too dissimilar to Mediterranean) with some natto or supplemental vitamin K2 thrown in to keep the calcium going to the bones and not the arteries (hopefully). Probably I'd have even less of the artery-crud if I hadn't drank so much soda when I was younger and stupider.

My Mom's doing great as well on a similar diet to mine (she's passed the ages that her parents passed away at, both of them), although she's also been on the statins for a while as well and she does other kinds of beans than the natto. We both drink assloads of coffee and tea, and that seems to be okay for us, although I argue the science on that with my cardiologist.

Oh, and endless amounts of conscious relaxation to cull any unneeded stress. Basically I'm doing everything that has some supporting scientific evidence that I can and hoping that's enough.

I dunno, man. The hard truth is that with a genetic predisposition you can do everything right and aggressively and still be screwed because we're just not there yet on the science behind what to do to cancel out the effects of which genes, if anything.

,ronnyhugo,"aging is seven processes, you can read all about it in a link I'll provide at the bottom, but lets take one easy example: We lose cells, and most are replaced by other cells dividing, but not all cells are replaced. We can't slow this down. We can however replace the lost cells with stem cell treatments, and the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCO) is already in human trials to do this for parkinson's patients (parkinson's being loss of cells in the brain). Then these people will be younger than before, but they will still age at the same rate. But no faster rate either. So if we successfully fix half the lost cells we'd be about half as old, and have half our life yet to improve the treatment. That is how people in the field of rejuvenation can say that the first person to live to become chronologically 1000 years old (chronometer = clock) is alive today, and chances are they will be just about 25 years old biologically for all this time (not like old and crumply like people think when they hear about someone being 1000 years old). 

Here's how aging works for the layman: https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/75dj9f/an_introduction_class_about_age_in_relation_to/ 

The important bit is that we don't leave any of the aging processes without treatments. So therefore it would be a good idea to support sens research foundation, because they fund research in the areas that are least researched. Because if we end up with great treatments for 5 or even 6 out of the 7 aging processes then we'd still end up with rather small increases in longevity and health and youthfulness.

,MaximilianKohler,"Comments/discussion from new_cryonet yahoo group:

&gt; The Journal of the American Cardiology just published it's latest meta-analysis of the effects of vitamin, mineral and antioxidant supplements on both cardiovascular disease incidence and all cause mortality: ""Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for CVD Prevention and Treatment"" (see attached paper). The results are very interesting and will no doubt come as a shock to those who put high stock in the use of shotgun supplementation, such as Life Extension Mix, and similar mega-supplement combination products.. The results of this meta-analysis support the earlier findings of Spindler, et al., in rodents, namely that such supplementation increases all cause mortality. Put another way, they shorten, not lengthen lifespan. This table nicely sums up the findings: https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0735109718345601-fx1.jpg

&gt; The only single supplement that really shined was folic acid, which showed a ~20% reduction in stroke and a 15% reduction in total CVD. A possible caveat here is that the large Chinese study included in the meta-analysis may have some positive bias due to the generally poorer folate nutrition status of the Chinese population. As I expected, the antioxidant vitamins A, C and E increased all cause mortality and failed to provide any protection from CVD. Selenium supplementation looks like it might be modestly positive and vitamin D seems to be a bust at the dosages used, but caused no harm. One thing seems clear do NOT take calcium supplements unless prescribed by a physician to treat a specific deficiency or disease.
&gt; 
&gt; The really interesting thing about these data are that despite clear reductions in CVD mortality (and morbidity) with folate and B vitamins, there was a negligible reduction in all cause mortality. This suggests that supplementation with folate and/or B vitamins is shifting mortality from CVD to something else; possibly cancer.
&gt; 
&gt; For cryonicists, this is good to know and is probably a worthwhile ""exchange of mortalities"". CVD results in brain destroying strokes and a vastly increased risk of sudden, unexpected death. Neither are good for cryonicists. However, for the general population these results will be interpreted as a wash. Who cares if you take ""expensive"" supplements and you don't live any longer, even you do die at a 20% lower rate from CVD? ""Take this pill and you are less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke, but you are more likely to die of, say, cancer."" That matters a lot to us, but not very much (if at all) to them.
&gt; 
&gt; These data point up just how much unjustified hype surrounds the marketing of supplements. They also underline that just because supplements are considered ""all natural"" they are, like any other molecule, drugs -- especially when administered in supraphysiologic amounts. Similarly, these data underscore the decades long profoundly negative experience of attempting to use animal (mostly rodent)  pharmacological experimental data to humans. Overwhelmingly such studies do not translate to humans. FWIW, my stance on this has not changed sine at least 1986 when I published the article ""Antioxidants And Aging: Thirty Years of Uncontrolled Experiments And Five Years Of Foolishness"" by Steve Harris, M.D. You can read that article here: 
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics8604.txt
&gt; 
&gt; Such studies also show the same pattern seen with drug trials in humans, namely that they are likely to produce initial, highly positive data that are contradicted by subsequent larger, better designed and better executed studies. From the standpoint of those seeking radical life extension all data currently available on supplements are a complete bust. The bottom line is that if you take supplements the best you can hope for is a shift in disease specific mortality and possibly a barely significant decrease in all cause mortality.
&gt; 
&gt; Another way to look at outcome is to look at the mean and maximum ages of  long time cryonicists when they deanimate, because that is the sub-population to which we all belong, and to compare that to a socioeconomically  matched cohort. Small differences in p values will be meaningless,, however, if it turns out that the mean age of those being cryopreserved is 105 or 115, well now, that would be something. And it would have to be something like that because if you consider the life expectancy of a white, middle class male with 2 years of college who does not smoke, drinks in moderation or not all, is noromotensive and has not been diagnosed with cancer, diabetes, heart disease or other degenerative diseases he has a life expectancy of 90. That's right, 90, providing of course he doesn't take Life Extension Mix.

,SirT6,"This is one of my favorite pet theories of aging - retrotransposons and other transposable/repetitive elements escape the defense mechanisms our genomes have to keep them in check and cause mayhem.

This paper was in termites, but it reminds me of similar research in mammals:

&gt; A war has been raging between mammalian genomes and [retrotransposons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon) for over 100 million years.

&gt; These insidious parasites use host replication machinery to 'copy and paste' themselves across the genome. And they have been enormously successful. Mammalian genomes are riddled with the scars of these 'copy and paste' events. Indeed, nearly half of the DNA content of the human genome is derived from retotransposons.

&gt; The reason retrotransposons are dangerous (in the context of human health) is that whenever they 'copy and paste' themselves, they create potentially mutagenic insertions. Depending on which genes are mutated, it is possible that a retrotransposition event can predispose a cell to cancerous transformation -- in fact, a hallmark of cancer genomes is increased copy number and heightened activity of these retrotransposons. Another interesting observation that researchers have made is that L1 retrotransposons (the focus of this study, and the most active of the mammalian retrotransposons) have a tendency to disrupt genes which regulate basic neurological function when they 'copy and paste' themselves in the brain. People have speculated that this may lead contribute to certain neurodegenerative disorders.

&gt; A lot of this was know before this paper. But many researchers have historically ignored L1 retrotransposons, assuming that they aren't terribly active in somatic tissue, and instead mostly impact the germ line. This paper begins to unravel that notion. It shows that during the course of aging, L1s become much more active, both in cells and in animals. Interestingly, in animals, aged brains exhibited the highest increase in L1 activity.

&gt; The researchers go on to show that the protein SIRT6 (my favorite protein, btw) plays a critical role in keeping these parasites silent in young tissue, by packaging them into heterochromatin. They also provide a model for how they become active in older tissue. Normally SIRT6 sits on these parasites, eeping them quiet. But it turns out SIRT6 has a lot of responsibilities in the cell, including DNA repair, regulating metabolism and keeping telomeres stable. As cells get older, DNA is damaged more easily, and SIRT6 is forced to vacate the retrotransposon sites to go repair the DNA. This creates a window of opportunity for these elements to escape repression and replicate themselves. Several other factors also appear to limit the ability of SIRT6 to suppress these parasites in old cells. For example, SIRT6 requires a substrate, NAD+, to perform its enzymatic activity. This metabolite is known to decrease in old cells, thus making SIRT6 less potent.

A lot of the benefits shown in the animal modals are with mammals that have far higher metabolism than ours, which is why IF confers a lot of the benefits of fasting since they deplete their glycogen much more quickly as well as induction of autophagy.

Also depending on how healthy you are now (low fasting blood glucose, high insulin sensitivity, normal blood pressure, normal triglycerides etc...), will effect how much of an improvement on IF will make. The more healthier you are the less of a dramatic effect IF will likely have.

&gt;How often should I do this?

For the typical IF protocol you'd need to do this everyday. Although I'd say you could get additional benefit from periodic extended fasts.

&gt;Is there any point starting now that I'm 27yrs old and in good health or should I wait until I'm older?

Given you have already matured into adolescence, and like everyone cannot escape time, in my opinion it would be worth at least trying, to see if it positively benefits you. If you wanted to be rigorous you'd have a panel of biomarkers before and after following an IF protocol for a couple of months. Then you could make an informed decision if the intervention is effective enough for you to take the effort of maintaining.

,ronnyhugo,"&gt; ahhh spoken like a oncology researcher 60 years ago...

The difference being now the rejuvenation treatment is to target the hTERT gene and ALT mechanism for telomere lengthening, such that when we poison the cells they can't divide indefinitely and return as resistant forms of themselves against the drug you just used. 

&gt; admit defeat and go back to studying the molecular pathways.

Each of our 37 200 billion cells have the ability to divide to become 37 200 billion cells, cancer is just when chemical accidents accidentally activates this ability. That telomeres get shorter with each cell division is how the body already resists cancer to some extent, because then the telomere-lengthening mechanism has to be activated as well with an additional chemical accident. Since cells with too short telomeres can't divide at all, its natural to thus remove that ability from all the cells we can. Then just force apoptosis of senescent cells that have too short telomeres to function, and replace them with stem-cells that also lack telomere-lengthening ability. Grown in the lab with artificially added telomere-lengthening substances. 

&gt; How do you ensure stemcell stability if you don't understand molecular pathways? each division increases the chance of DNA damage, which increases the risk of either mutation into cancer or apoptosis.

The DNA damage from this would not occur to a dangerous level in a thousand years, or even a hundred thousand years. Because the damage would be random on the DNA strand, most of which isn't even a gene, let alone a gene that is active in a certain cell. The current problem with DNA is the 13 mitochondrial genes that basically get eaten up by the lysosome whenever the lysosome ""blob"" ruptures because of the high-energy activity around the mitochondria. So eventually some cells have no working mitochondria and switch the ATP process to pumping harmful substances directly out of the cell wall to continue ATP production. 

Note that no matter the DNA damage, without the hTERT gene and ALT mechanism, no cell can divide more than the hayflick limit. 

&gt; Either way...A research team studying metabolic pathways and coming up with a potential target to increase overall metabolic health still sounds like a win to me. Research is not an all or nothing game and just because we think we have a roadmap to achieving true life extension doesn't mean that roadmap is correct. Scientific discovery often comes from the most unexpected of places...such as leaving petrie dishes full of bacteria next to petrie dishes full of mold.

Well the thing is SENS (strategies for engineered negligible senescence) is currently the petri dish where someone discovered that something that grows there, kills mold. it is now we have to develop it, instead of every single researcher out there going ""I'm just going to keep going as I always have, working on my own little petri dish, which so far haven't yielded much"". Which is basically what every cancer researcher is doing. So few cancer researchers I have spoken to, even understands that the telomere-lengthening mechanism is something they could target, because they haven't bothered to read up on the rejuvenation treatment to cancer known as WILT. Instead they're focusing on producing yet another drug, even though the remaining 1% of cancer cells in each patient, will continue to divide and return, now resistant to the wonder drug.

These numbers speak for themselves, they are all you need to answer when all amazing therapies will be available in the clinics.

If you take a close look at NIH or NIA funded work… well… You will find hundreds of publications about obesity, lifestyle, air pollution and their impact on longevity. Don’t you know that obesity, smoking and much drinking of alcohol is bad for you? How can this information may help us create a new cure against cancer, Alzheimer’s or atherosclerosis? Do we really need another one work on it?

Also you can find many publications about calorie restriction and various genetic manipulations on worms and other model organisms that mimic it. Calorie restriction is everywhere! While we know for twenty years that CR does not work for humans. In 2015, $500,000 was given to projects like *“A Large Randomized Trial of Vitamin D, Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline”*. It’s not a joke, it’s a real research work! You can find more [here](https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending_project_listing.aspx?ARRA=N&amp;DCat=Aging&amp;FY=2015).

,K1ngN0thing,"&gt;Selling a million dollar treatment to a 10 million people (there are 14 million millionaires in the world) is more lucrative than selling a $1000 treatment to 7 billion, and much easier logistically. This is true no matter how long the time span is.

it's also a great way to get yourself killed. hence my earlier point, which you've chosen to ignore this time (you have a habit of doing that). your numbers also don't really make sense. we're not talking about one-off payments. say it's yearly, say 1000 a year, then multiply that by most of the population. millionaires aren't going to pay a million a year, and I don't think all of these ""elite"" are going to be okay with having exclusive access to these treatments. they're probably also smart enough to realize that the only reason they're paying a million (again, a random number you pulled out of your ass based on the assumption that the leaders of these companies would rather live in constant fear of being killed rather than solve some trivial logistical problems) is because the seller doesn't feel like selling it to more people at a cheaper price. let's ignore the fact that not all of these millionaires live in countries that require you to pay for health care outright. let's also ignore the fact that a lot of these millionaires don't actually have a million in liquidity. granting all of this, is the ensuing uprising worth an extra 3 trillion dollars, when you'd still be making 7 trillion otherwise? it just doesn't make any fucking sense.

&gt;Your notion of cost effectiveness seems to be from perspective of the patient, not the care provider. Why would the care provider prefer one that generates less revenue?

it comes from the perspective of what actually goes into the treatment. it's a lot cheaper to inject someone once in a while than it is to repeatedly have them in the hospital for days or weeks on end. an aging population is also less productive, so you're losing at both ends, and any country that doesn't utilize these treatments will soon be uncompetitive.

Skimmed it but didn't see anything mentioning 20 years. saw 14, and also seems like it's mostly due to the poor and uneducated making poorer choices. people don't tend to care about this, but they will care when it's their own lives on the line.

&gt;You ask me for a source on something intuitive like the rich living longer than the poor, but you make claims like this with no backing:

well developed today in that we can manipulate biology on a cellular level. biotechnology is rapidly declining in price (compare the cost to sequence a genome (or grow a lab burger) from less than a decade ago to today, then extrapolate 10 years into the future. couple that with ever-increasing technological advances and you'll see why this is not on the top of my list of concerns. 

&gt;Everybody has their religion, this honestly sounds like its yours. If it comforts you, just believe what you want.

when you can't come up with a sound counterpoint, just patronize. from where I'm sitting, you look a lot more like someone who's blindly sticking to a narrative, based on your propensity to ignore at least one key point every time you respond, and a seeming unwillingness to consider multiple variables simultaneously. I don't claim to know what it will take, but I haven't. I've provided my reasoning to why I think it won't be as expensive as you think, but it could be. in that case, it's hard to imagine it taking more than 5-10 years to come down in price. if technology is the bottleneck, there will be astronomical amounts of cash thrown at the problem, but as technology advances much faster than our understanding, it doesn't seem too likely to be the issue, which leaves us with these companies wanting to recoup R&amp;D costs, in which case, refer back to the 10million vs 7billion argument. 

&gt;I say semi because it's founded on biological principles, and not actual knowledge of root causes of aging - which have not been established. 

I think we understand the causes well enough, but I fall into the repair/maintenance/engineering camp. maybe you're of the opinion that we need to prevent damage in the first place. in that case, sure, we're not anywhere near curing aging.


&gt;SENS has a budget of what, $5 million, $10 million a year at most? If I had to place my bets on which of the existing anti-aging plays would succeed - between the multi-billion dollar one backed by Google, or the one backed by Jeff Bezos, or the charity with a $5 million budget, I would probably not be betting on the charity. 

The amount of money in play doesn't matter if the approach is wrong. My money's on the engineering approach. They've already made valuable contributions with their measly budget. More importantly, google and Bezos have plenty of money, so even if there were a 75% chance of their approach being correct, we should still put our support behind the 25% chance given they rely solely on donations. 

&gt;And if it is a private company that brings the treatment to market, they will follow market principles, because they need to make their money back.

sources please.

&gt;Treatments for cancer and heart disease, conditions - which affect 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 people at some point in their lifetimes - are free since they affect nearly everyone, right?

they should be, but the argument was one of cost-effectiveness, and it's cheaper to prevent these illnesses than to treat them (usually futilely) when they've progressed to this point.

&gt;A treatment for aging is likely to manifest in a suite of multiple costly therapies. It is likely to cost an unprecedented fortune in research, experimentation, and time to create. These treatments will be patented.

Assume they are patented, then refer back to my argument about an enormous customer base. Given that these treatments aren't inherently expensive to manufacture, there is no reason not to sell it at a cost available to the vast majority of people. We *should* have socialized or universal health care, but even if we don't by then, and you're looking at things solely through the lens of profit, then it still makes sense to make it affordable to the majority. If we don't have health care reform by this point, I think this will be the what forces it.

Doesn't really how much it costs to develop. Short-term profit won't matter as much with longer lifespans. What you would want is to capture as much of the consumer base as you can, and have them as customers for centuries to come. In a decade, your profits would obliterate anything you put into it.

&gt;For companies to convince their shareholders and board to invest heavily in R&amp;D to treat something, they need to make a case that they can eventually profit for it.

Which is why there is increasing support for nonprofits like SENS, who work to prove concepts and reduce risk for investors and developers. Their work has already been spun off into at least one company.

&gt;As for your example, it took about 25 years for cell phones to get into the hands of the masses.

25 years for something that wouldn't lead to death if not obtained, for something that was purely a luxury and something a lot of people probably didn't even seen the point in owning for the first few years, for something that was inherently expensive to manufacture due to the sourcing, refining, and assembly of the various raw materials involved. the technology to manufacture rejuvenative medicine is already well-developed. the raw materials required for these medicines are readily available. if anything, the bottleneck will be in the logistics of treating so many people, but given that only people over a certain age would need the treatments, and then only every 10 years or so, that's not likely to be too much of an issue.",3,1525476923,longevity

Don't you think you've got a case of depression/dysphoria? PhDs have it pretty hard, so they are known for having mental health issues (not surprising - lots of work in competitive environment for low pay...).
Or do you have rational explanations for falling motivation? For example the reproducibility crisis currently looming in science is a valid reason to become disillusioned in science, but not all fields of science have fallen, and different fields have different degrees trustworthiness. Even if this crisis is the reason of your demotivation, could you research some means of mitigating it, at least in your own research? I.E. bayesian statistics, careful controls, replication.

Also: you may feel that your goal is not worth pursuing, but is it worth it for your children or their children?

About more concrete measures: currently you are in a position where you can gather data and even design and set up experiments to produce more data. Don't you think it would be nice to produce a longevity-related dataset (say, a table of biomarkers vs age for some kind of cell line, or tissue culture) and release it into the open under a permissive license? Then people could build predictive models from this data. I understand they hospitals are very paranoid when it comes to data, but if you made such a dataset and released it, it would be a lasting contribution.

I understand that you are probably currently deep inside publish-or-perish culture. So, could you have basically two lines of work - one, ordindary, to stay employed as a researcher, and another one, an ambitious one - longevity related one?

And at last: 8 years ago you dreamed about changing the status quo, yet you had no credentials. Now you almost have your PhD, this is a very rare opportunity, and the timing is not half bad. Could you look a bit outside the academia, into anti-ageing startups and private R&amp;D corp departments to regain your motivation? These organizations are not dependent on publish-or-perish cycle; they can afford long-term projects and applying latest technologies and machine learning.
Examples of corp R&amp;D are Google's Calico and Verily - they hire top researchers to build a baseline human model https://www.projectbaseline.com/ and to develop anti-ageing interventions.
Then there is Craig Venter's Human Longevity Inc (I also recommend to read his biography, it's pretty motivating).
There is also a tangentially related Human Diagnosis Project https://www.humandx.org/

Likewise, many people would rather hedge their bets conservatively in favor of good life/health span just in case the therapies don't become available in their lifetime.
  
2. **Cost**. Looking at current immunotherapy as an example, it's reasonable to assume that a SENS based therapy won't be as cheap as small molecule therapies that have been off patent for decades. (AMPk activators like metformin comes to mind. Literally $4 for a 1 month supply.)

* Home-cooked meals high in vegetables and fruit, low in meat.
* Avoid processed foods.
* No sugary drinks.
* Vitamin D3, K2 and magnesium (in my country it is basically impossible to get enough vitamin D for half of the year, and I don't go outside enough anyway).
* Eat fermented foods (kefir particularly) and foods which are prebiotics (onions, garlic, beans etc), and try to avoid antibiotics - obviously there have been occasions where I had to take them to avoid death, but I'm shocked by how often people I know take antibiotics just because they have a cold.
* Lifting weights and cardio.
* Avoid plastics where possible, e.g. if something can be bought in glass or cardboard instead of a tin or plastic I will buy that. When freezing meals I use glass containers instead of plastic.

I also do a few things which are known to be good for the brain or good for health, but which probably won't extend lifespan by much, but might extend healthspan (how long I am healthy for):

* Eat oily fish twice per week.
* Eat blueberries or other berries every day.
* Eat dark chocolate or raw cocoa every day.
* Frequently adding turmeric with black pepper to my cooking.
* Eat cruciferous vegetables most days (broccoli, kale, etc.)
* Tea and coffee.
* Red wine (debatable whether beneficial in moderation, but I'm going to drink anyway, so might as well get some resveratrol and phenolic compounds).
* Astaxanthin supplement (only started this recently, but the evidence looks good, and anecdotally I am impressed already).

However, I wouldn't debate in favor of it for the following reasons. Some cancer types don't require telomerase activation. And if a cell bound to become cancerous has the ability to enable telomerase production is the fact that it was enabled already a significant advantage?

Imagine I have to make a painting and I am able to buy paint. Receiving free paint is nice, but insignificant to my ability to accomplish my goal.

I cant argue that activating telomerase is such a hurdle for precancerous cell that doing it for them would significantly result in cancer.

Think of it:

-If it is such a hurdle, why is it so common in cancers.

-If it is so significant, why some cancers do fine without it.

-And, how does it compare to other anticancer checkpoint like those in the cell cycle and immune evasion ones?

My non-expert hypothesis on the matter is that telomerase presence is not as significant to proliferation of cancer (to a degree that it impairs a patients health) as hiding from the immune system is. And that, due to this, telomerase activation would not increase the likelihood of cancer for a given patient.

Also, telomerase activation would not boost lifespan possibly due to it enabling the proliferation of noncancerous unhealthy tissue.

,Matthew_Lake,"""We know this because the practice of calorie restriction does not reliably produce 110-year-old humans""

I just posted this on the CRS forum, but I've never come across anyone IRL who is ""thin"" and eating anything that resembles a healthy low-calorie CRON diet.

In my local area, a study found less than 1% of men had all 5 healthy lifestyle habits, which included eating at least 5 fruits and vegetables per day.

There is also clearly great variation in human lifespan. It's interesting to look at the health and biomarkers of centenarians and their offspring. It appears that many of the changes induced by calorie restriction, are to a mild extent, shown in centenarians.

As you probably know, being a child of a centenarian does increase your chances of becoming one significantly. People on CRON (see WUSTL studies) have significantly better profiles than centenarian offspring for almost every measure: glucose, cholesterol, inflammation, blood pressure, weight, insulin sensitivity etc.

Either none of these matter for longevity (which is wrong), we know that the elimination of heart attacks, stroke and diabetes (which is extremely unlikely for someone on CRON) would add over 10 years of life just there.

Calorie restriction in lemur primates did show significant life extension (almost 50%). And if you took out deaths from accidents and death from anesthesia during MRI scanning, then 60% of the CR monkeys are still alive after *all* controls have died, and 60% are alive at beyond the previously known maximum lifespan for that species.

The gain in lifespan is also more than what was predicted by Aubrey and his criticism of CR.

The issue with CR in animals is species-specific mortalities.  I.e in the dog study, there were a significant number of dogs who were euthanized because of hip dysplasia. The dogs could have been otherwise healthy, but due to a mechanical design flaw, this would prevent the full effect of CR on lifespan. Nevertheless, results were still impressive, and they were weren't even CR'd that much.

In the NIA rhesus monkey study, many of the female monkeys died from endometriosis. Which is not something most humans die of, right?  It was also interesting to see triglycerides of female monkeys MUCH higher than those on CR. This is the polar opposite of what is observed in rodents AND in humans on CRON.

And again there were deaths from accidents, gastric bloat (from overcooked food in UW study), and anesthesia during MRI / biopsies. These could be deemed mostly preventable deaths or something which is unlikely to happen to most humans on CR.  None of these tell you anything whatsoever about the effect of CR on aging. 

I wrote a **[review](http://www.crvitality.com/2014/04/calorie-restriction-in-rhesus-monkeys/)** of the rhesus monkey studies. Look at the tables.

It might tell you that you are more likely to die of an accident. But to a large extent, this is a modifiable risk factor.

The main issue for people on CRON is likely to be infections, IMO.

We have more than 2 primate studies, I think there are 4 or 5 now.

It's not surprising that in every one of them it was CR monkeys who broke longevity records.

Out of over 2000 monkeys in the database, only 2 rhesus monkeys had ever lived beyond 40 before these studies. In the old-onset NIA CR group, 5 or 6 of them out of 20 monkeys lived beyond 40, with the oldest being 43. 

Rhesus monkeys age approx 3 times faster than humans, although this is just an estimate based on their development and other factors.

Previously it was C58 who lived to 41, and he was on CR as well.

But how can monkey studies tell you anything about the translability of CR in humans if:

- NIA and UW both had issues in maintaining CR properly as done in rodents
- NIA study never intervened medically in the rhesus monkeys health problems (why females died from endometriosis)
- The rhesus monkeys did not even respond to CR the way rodents and humans DO respond to CR **
- There were many deaths from preventable causes, especially in the CR group (mostly early in the study). Age-related mortality curve shows the advantage of CR. 
- The NIA controls monkeys were actually CR'd (10%) and their careres were saying (at a CR conference) how the monekys were throwing away their food. But also, 10% CR is some strains of mice and rats can have as much of an effect as 30-40% (http://www.crvitality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lifespan.png)  (see survival curves).

There are more reasons, but that'll do for now :0

,shrillthrill,"If you look at the CR research from a high level view and are willing the entertain some hypotheses and defer to animal studies, it appears that protein restriction, achieving methionine restriction, but also less activation of mTOR (restriction of leucine), are partial mechanisms in slowing some age related damage/disease.   

This way in theory, you don't necessarily need to restrict calories to the point that you are continually losing bodyfat, if you went with something close to the Okinawa ratio:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916345/ (~pre-1960s Okinawa, Japan - who have had something like 5x the amount of centenarians compared to other nations).   Approximately 9% protein and 85% carbohydrates (mostly non-refined, e.g. sweet potato), with a remaining 6% fat.  

Is that ratio easily achievable? In my experience, somewhere around ~73C ~16P ~12F is more doable on a whole food plant based diet while incorporating sesame seeds, flax seed meal, a daily brazil nut, and allowing for olives.

As an aside: The broader question of whether any of this matters for longevity is typically raised in these discussions, pointing out that people who eat subjectively worse or don't do CR can end up living longer - and diet alone will not bring about LE.

**The relationship between peripheral blood mononuclear cells telomere length and diet - unexpected effect of red meat**

Abstract

----

Background

Repeated nucleotide sequences combined with proteins called telomeres cover chromosome ends and dictate cells lifespan. Many factors can modify telomere length, among them are: nutrition and smoking habits, physical activities and socioeconomic status measured by education level.

The aim of the study was to determine the influence of above mentioned factors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells telomere length.

Methods

Study included 28 subjects (seven male and 21 female, age 18–65 years.), smokers and non-smokers without any serious health problems in past and present. Following a basic medical examination, patients completed the food frequency questionnaire with 17 foods and beverages most common groups and gave blood for testing. PBMC telomere length were measured with qualitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) method and expressed as a T/S ratio.

Results

Among nine food types (cereal, fruits, vegetables, diary, red meat, poultry, fish, sweets and salty snacks) and eight beverages (juices, coffee, tea, mineral water, alcoholic- and sweetened carbonated beverages) only intake of red meat was related to T/S ratio. Individuals with increased consumption of red meat have had higher T/S ratio and the strongest significant differences were observed between consumer groups: “never” and “1–2 daily” (p = 0.02).

Philosophically, at least, you might (wrongly) compare the quest for longevity to the quest for a perpetual motion machine.  The laws of thermodynamics say we will have to keep putting energy into any system to get work out of it.

The same with the fight to extend life and health.  We are unlikely to get to the place where we have an indefinite lifespan (Theoretical goal), but we can easily learn ways to extend healthspan and lifespan.

Our theoretical goal is currently so far off that it is easy to mock those of us who look at that horizon.  The fact remains that we have already learned and accomplished many milestones on that journey.

An interesting point [made here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2625386/) is that wealth distribution in society makes a big difference, as the poor (of ancient times) are thought to have lived short, painul lives compared to those who could afford better circumstances.

The ""life expectancy"" figures from the past are low if you do not remove **child and infant mortality** from your calculations.  Since these are generally not what we are considering for longevity it is probably a helpful statistical tool.

There are lots of problems with the historical calculations above (small sample, wealth, privilege etc.) but there is an important point to note.  **The greatest good for the greatest number** may be achieved through policy or culture changes as much as through medical breakthroughs.

Good hygiene, good food, good water, clean air, good exercise, may do more now than some of our medical hopes.

Big data methods may show us incremental steps that add a few years to the average life or healthspan.

**We really need a breakthrough** and this will likely come only when we have more scientists working on the problems.  The critique is a little like people poking fun at early rocket science.  It is easy to mock the efforts of others, but those working on life extension will have many successes if they have resources to work with.

,Intra_Galactic,"Thanks for the additional info - my own comments:

- Inhibiting mTor leads to less muscle mass but also to greater longevity in animal models. More muscles means usually more mTor activity. -&gt; In animal models, yes, but I'd say that even if it didn't lead to a prolonged life span in humans, the prolonged health span is more than worth it. I think that life extension is fantastic, but the key point I want to make here is that life extension alone won't do anything unless you actually extend health span with it. If I had a choice to prolong my life as my 30 year old self for a small period of time versus my 100 year old self for an extended period of time, I would choose the former latter than the latter, and I think that the focus should be a bit more on extending both health span and life span rather than focusing on just one aspect of life extension.
- Many people propose a low-carb diet with intermittent Ketosis for longevity instead of high carb diet. Can you show some evidence the people who undergo Ketosis live longer lives than people that don't? Keep in mind that I don't disagree with the premise of going with a low-glycemic index diet - and in general, I believe that fasting (which does promote Ketosis) does extend life and health span, it's just that I think the it depends on how you define Keto. Which fats you choose to consume is going to make a huge difference in the effect you get. In the same manner, which carbs you consume on a 'high-carb' diet will also make a huge difference to the impact the diet will have on you. Note that by high-carb, I meant a 'high-carb' diet based on plants/healthy food choices which don't spike insulin levels into oblivion. The same principle goes with Keto - I believe that a Keto diet which is composed of a lot of healthy fats (like nuts) would be more ideal for life extension rather than one which includes a lot of meat/protein and unhealthy fats - so, my response there to your comment would be -&gt; it's complex so 'it depends.' Ideally, I would say that a mixture of a natural plant based low glycemic index food along with a mixture of healthy fats would be ideal – so why not combine the best of both worlds?
- You say at some point long living people often eat the same food every day but stress at other points that it is important to eat a diverse diet. As a note – what I posted there is a summary of what the author of the book I linked to found in studying Blue Zones – I don't necessarily agree that adhering to every point listed there would result in life extension. Just as in my other comments, my answer here would be 'it depends.' I believe that variety is actually more ideal – but as long as the variety you're putting into your body is based on healthy food choices rather than processed junk food, food loaded with sugar, or high-insulin refined carbohydrate choices. Another great book I tend to agree with is Michael Pollen's 'In Defense of Food,' which essentially states: “Eat food.  Not too much.  Mostly plants. Our food system has long devoted its energies to increasing yields and selling food as cheaply as possible. Clearly the achievements of industrial agriculture have come at a cost:  It can produce a great many more calories per acre, but each of those calories may supply less nutrition than it formerly did; Don’t eat anything your great grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food; Avoid food products containing ingredients that are:  a) unfamiliar, b) unpronounceable, c) more than five in number, or that include d) high-fructose corn syrup; Avoid food products that make health claims; Get out of the supermarket whenever possible; Eat wild foods when you can; Eat well-grown food from healthy soils (use Farmer's market/CSA box/your own garden); Have a glass of wine with dinner; Pay more, eat less; Eat until you are 80 percent full; Eat Meals; Do all your eating at a table and don't eat alone; Eat slowly; Cook and, if you can, plant a garden.”

 * Long-lived people live on a high-carb, low-fat, plant-based diet; 
 * Long-lived people eat a lot of vegetables, including greens; 
 * Whenever they can get it, long-lived populations eat a lot of fruit; 
 * When animal products are consumed, it’s occasionally and in small amounts only; 
 * Long-lived people had periods in their life when a lot less food was available and they had to survive on a very 
  sparse, limited diet; 
  * Long-lived people live in a sunny, warm climate; 
  * Long-lived people consume beans in some form or another; 
  * Nuts appear to be good for health; 
  * The typical diet is very simple and many essentially eat the same simple foods every day 
  * Quality food over variety is more important; 
  * They had an active lifestyle and moved a lot 
  * Many of them got 5 to 6 hours of moderate exercise per day; 
  * Many of them loved to work and had a sense of purpose in life; 
  * Many had large families; 
  * None of them smoked or ate massive amounts of food.

* Be a super-ager – “Which activities, if any, will increase your chances of remaining mentally sharp into old age? We’re still studying this question, but our best answer at the moment is: work hard at something. Many labs have observed that these critical brain regions increase in activity when people perform difficult tasks, whether the effort is physical or mental. You can therefore help keep these regions thick and healthy through vigorous exercise and bouts of strenuous mental effort.” Source: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/opinion/sunday/how-to-become-a-superager.html

* Boost your microbiome by eating a diverse diet. “Diet is perhaps the biggest factor in shaping the composition of the microbiome,” he says. A study by University College Cork researchers published in Nature in 2012 followed 200 elderly people over the course of two years, as they transitioned into different environments such as nursing homes. The researchers found that their subjects’ health – frailty, cognition, and immune system – all correlated with their microbiome. From bacterial population alone, researchers could tell if a patient was a long-stay patient in a nursing home, or short-stay, or living in the general community. These changes were a direct reflection of their diet in these different environments. “A diverse diet gives you a diverse microbiome that gives you a better health outcome,” says Cryan.

* Have a healthy mind-set – don't ever succumb to the stereotypical mind set that getting older = decline. “To Langer, this was evidence that the biomedical model of the day — that the mind and the body are on separate tracks — was wrongheaded. The belief was that “the only way to get sick is through the introduction of a pathogen, and the only way to get well is to get rid of it,” she said, when we met at her office in Cambridge in December. She came to think that what people needed to heal themselves was a psychological “prime” — something that triggered the body to take curative measures all by itself. Gathering the older men together in New Hampshire, for what she would later refer to as a counterclockwise study, would be a way to test this premise. The men in the experimental group were told not merely to reminisce about this earlier era, but to inhabit it — to “make a psychological attempt to be the person they were 22 years ago,” she told me. “We have good reason to believe that if you are successful at this,” Langer told the men, “you will feel as you did in 1959.” From the time they walked through the doors, they were treated as if they were younger. The men were told that they would have to take their belongings upstairs themselves, even if they had to do it one shirt at a time. At the end of their stay, the men were tested again. On several measures, they outperformed a control group that came earlier to the monastery but didn’t imagine themselves back into the skin of their younger selves, though they were encouraged to reminisce. They were suppler, showed greater manual dexterity and sat taller — just as Langer had guessed. Perhaps most improbable, their sight improved. Independent judges said they looked younger. The experimental subjects, Langer told me, had “put their mind in an earlier time,” and their bodies went along for the ride.” Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html

Strive to accomplish something or to help others. “It is the pursuit of meaning is what makes human beings uniquely human. By putting aside our selfish interests to serve someone or something larger than ourselves -- by devoting our lives to ""giving"" rather than ""taking"" -- we are not only expressing our fundamental humanity, but are also acknowledging that that there is more to the good life than the pursuit of simple happiness.” Source: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/theres-more-to-life-than-being-happy/266805/

* Volunteer and help others. “Volunteering probably reduces mortality by a year and a half or possibly up to two years for people who are in their senior years,” says Stephen G. Post, a professor of preventive medicine at Stony Brook University School of Medicine and the author of The Hidden Gifts of Helping and Why Good Things Happen to Good People. “If you could put the benefits of helping others into a bottle and sell it, you could be a millionaire in a minute.” Source: https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why+do+we+hesitate+to+help%3F-a0352848707

*****************

**Summary and recommendations**

&gt;The emerging data from human clinical trials confirms
what the past decade of in vitro and laboratory animal
models have suggested; resveratrol has considerable poten-
tial to improve health and prevent chronic disease in
humans. We believe the evidence is sufficiently strong to
conclude that a single dose of resveratrol is able to induce
beneficial physiologic responses, and that either weeks or
months of resveratrol supplementation produces physiolo-
gic changes that are predictive of improved health, especially
in clinical populations with compromised health. However,
it is not yet certain if long-term resveratrol supplementation
will maintain these physiologic benefits to ultimately impact
the incidence of chronic disease or extend lifespan, and the
small number of human clinical trials remains dwarfed by
the thousands of basic science experiments. Nonetheless,
we believe it is possible that healthy individuals may still
benefit from resveratrol’s potential to delay or prevent age
and lifestyle induced decrements in health, though consid-
erable research is needed on this front. To further evaluate
resveratrol’s potential for widespread use in human medi-
cine, we recommend continued research exploring a gamut
of physiologic responses in humans, ranging from gene expression through clinical measurements and health
outcomes. 

&gt;**Future research should aim to:**

(i) Compare **different dosages and/or formulations of resver-
atrol, in terms of both efficacy and bioavailability.** The use
of a single dosage or formulation does not readily help to
identify the optimal dosage or synergistic combination to
achieve a given outcome, or the target plasma concentra-
tion required to achieve this outcome in humans.

(ii) Examine **comparative efficacy of resveratrol to alter-
natives for a given outcome/treatment**. For resveratrol
to be considered a serious option in the prevention and
treatment of chronic disease, it is critical to determine
if resveratrol is superior to existing therapies in terms
of cost, safety, and/or efficacy.

(iii) Determine if resveratrol can have either **additive or
synergistic effects in combination with other therapies.**
Much of the current research has focused on resveratrol
as a stand-alone therapeutic agent, however, it is possible
that resveratrol supplementation may synergistically
enhance existing therapeutic devices or compounds.

(iv) Study the effects of **long-term resveratrol supplementa-
tion.** The acute effects of resveratrol are evident, but it
is not yet clear how this relates to long-term health.
Additionally, it is unknown how long it takes for the
effects of resveratrol to plateau and if tachyphalaxis
(a rapid decrease in responsiveness after chronic
exposure) occurs.

(v) Further **determine the activity of resveratrol’s metabo-
lites. Human clinical trials have generally concentrated
on attaining targeted concentrations of free resveratrol,
but the possibility that resveratrol’s metabolites are
bioactive warrants further consideration.**

(vi) Determine **what genetic factors account for differences
in bioavailability and physiologic responses** to resvera-
trol **between individuals**. As medicine moves to more
individualized approaches, it will be increasingly valu-
able to know whether an individual is likely to respond
to resveratrol favorably or not.

CoQ can also be depleted with age or lack of enough intake via diet -- I'm not up on the lit on whether or not CoQ also operates as a signaling molecule, but would not be surprised there are similarities to NAD+ here.

I'm very interested in paper - [Resveratrol improves learning and memory in normally aged mice through microRNA-CREB pathway](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X13008073) because longer life is not much value if it does not increase healthspan and good mental function.

&gt;we observed a **positive effect of RSV on memory formation and LTP induction in these aged mice**


A little more info on the (presumed?) method of action 

&gt; our previous studies have suggested the role of miRNAs in regulating LTP, we analyzed the levels several brain specific miRNAs in RSV-treated hippocampus slices. Interestingly, the levels of miR-134 and 124 were down-regulated in RSV treated individuals. MiR-124 is one of the most conserved and abundantly expressed NS-specific miRNAs in brain and miR-134 is a brain-specific miR [36,37]. Both of them are reported to regulate CREB expression [22,26,27], which in turn regulates the activation of immediate early genes that ultimately facilitates synaptic plasticity. Taken together, these data indicate a positive relationship between RSV treatment and synapse plasticity, which can in turn impact learning and memory.


SO I went looking for more background.  There are a couple of **good reviews**.

&gt; The **most important dietary source of resveratrol is red wine**, and it is often postulated to be an
important factor in the French Paradox, a term coined to
describe the observation that **the French population has a
very low incidence of cardiovascular disease, despite a diet
high in saturated fats**.

**also an antioxidant**

&gt;Similar to most polyphenols,
resveratrol has intrinsic anti-oxidant capacity, but it
also induces the expression of a number of anti-oxidant
enzymes, making it difficult to decipher the precise contribution
of each mechanism to an overall reduction in
oxidative stress 


the goal of this review (first below) is a huge undertaking, and the review is quite long and thorough.  (all were found on libgen)

&gt; intense media coverage highlighting its potential
applications in the prevention and treatment of age-related
diseases has inspired many individuals to try resveratrol
supplements, and many companies to develop either
resveratrol-based drugs or nutraceuticals. Indeed, a 2007
cross-sectional study found that **supplemental resveratrol is
taken by 2/3 of people who routinely consume multiple
dietary supplements,** and this number may have
increased as studies describing resveratrol’s health benefits
have reached the mainstream media. Because of the
continued public interest and the explosion of resveratrol
supplements on the market, **an urgent need exists to
summarize the available clinical literature, which is the
overarching goal of the present review.**

there is **good info on bioavailability** from wine and juice, and from supplements.

Any type of Academic or Professor simply loves State Funded Academics. It pays for their bills and pension, and further wage increases, aka they want more public funding to Public Universities and the status quo.

The rest of the Far Leftists in this movement are the European Counterparts. Americans in general like I said are more fans of limited Government, because they have a history of knowing what happens when Government is too large.

Europeans are just in general, except for Switzerland, in favor of huge Government and Single Payer Healthcare systems; what leads to is a bloated all-encompassing Big Brother Overbearing European Union Beauraucratic Nightmare.

Most leftists and Europeans are obsessed with the WHO World Health Organization of their further discussion and funding towards aging, and getting WHO to classify Aging as a Disease.

American Leftists are obsessed with more Taxation and growth of the U.S. federal government, aka growth of the NIH and funding from the NIH.

Like you and I already discussed and like I said in previous posts, these people do not have clarity of vision and instead they have limited mindsets. They do not believe or consider other options, or in Market competition; or in competition of Federal Governments vs Large Corporations vs Non-Profit Foundations vs Private Small Entities.

The solution to Aging and Longevity IS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. Billionaires have the time and connections and knowledge to accelerate things forward past the slow bureaucratic pace of Government. ",3,1522273248,longevity

*************************

&gt;Conclusion

S. rebaudiana Bertoni is an ancient South American plant with
great potential as an agricultural crop for the production of a
high-potency natural sweetener. Owing to its proximate composition
and its **content of health-promoting phytochemical constituents**,
it is also a suitable raw material for the extraction and
production of functional food ingredients. It is a good source of carbohydrates,
protein, crude fibre, minerals, as well as dispensable
and indispensable amino acids which are valuable for human
nutrition. **The sweetening compounds, found mainly in the leaves
of the plant, are steviol glycosides, with stevioside being the most
abundant, followed by rebaudioside A**.

 Stevioside has a sweetening
power comparable to that of artificial sweeteners presently
marketed and consumed in several foods and beverages. **It is about
300 times sweeter than saccharose**. Rebaudioside A is known to be
even sweeter (up to 450 times sweeter than saccharose) and can be
refined to a purity of over 97%. The leaves, as well as the pure stevioside
extract, can be used in its natural state or cooked, and are
**thermostable at temperature up to 200 C**. They are non-fermentative
low-calorie, non-toxic sweeteners, flavour enhancing and have
been tested objectively, based on **direct observations on human
and animals, showing them to be non-mutagenic, non-teratogenic
and non-carcinogenic**. 

Stevia has been consumed by human beings
for centuries without any negative effects. This showed the advantages
of stevia over other artificial sweeteners as an ingredient for
the food industry, thereby making Stevia a more suitable substitute
for saccharose in different drinks, beverages and bakery products.
Apart from the sweet contents, **S. rebaudiana with its secondary
plant constituents also offers therapeutic benefits, having antihyperglycaemic,
anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antitumour,
anti-diarrhoeal, diuretic, and immunomodulatory effects.**",9,1521993279,longevity

A [Defined contribution plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_contribution_plan)  is a type of retirement plan in which the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis.

If I am contributing to **MY PLAN** then I want some choice in how I use it.  Most private and corporate plans are like this.  I pay into MY PLAN as an investment (often tax sheltered) for MY FUTURE.  This is the idea they are selling with ""freedom 55"" marketing - that **if you invest wisely you will have enough invested to generate the income you need** to live well in your later years without needing to work.  This is usually done by purchasing an [annuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_annuity)

&gt;Pensions are only for people who can't work anymore

**most private pensions are investments used to buy an annuity**

Most government plans of social welfare are [Defined benefit pension plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_benefit_pension_plan).

Here the tax payers (in general) pay into the plan through taxes, and are promised a small income even if they have been bad savers, or have been unable or even unwilling to work in their ""prime working years"".

You are correct that we can raise the minimum pension age for this type of pension if people are healthy and able to work.  Since I don't expect this to be a (major) part of my income in retirement, it really should be saved for those in need.

Here is the strange thin about our ""working life""

In harsher times we had to add child labour laws so kids could go to school.  Lets say a working life started at age 10 before these laws.

Often people worked until they died, but even in more enlightened times they worked to age 70 and died before age 80 with only 10 years of post income living.

Now many do not finish school (university) before age 25 - This is 15 years less of work to store up wealth for retirement.

Many now retire at age 60, with 30 years of post income living.

the big change is that we are currently working less years, and with that income we are trying to pay off debt (student loans), live like rich people (more toys) and retire earlier and save for a longer retirement.

This means we must save fare more even though our working years are much shorter.

It is hard to do this,



Also, I am curious about your age and work history, because many of us older people (age 55 now and changing jobs and wondering if I want to retire)  have put off things like travel and toys while bringing up a family and paying for their university, and paying off mortgages and learning to invest.

&gt; From the 16th century to the 18th century, individuals worked to extend the lives and vitality of elderly people; they **believed senescence was a time of considerable worth**. From the 19th century through the early 20th century, however, anti-age advocates generally **depicted old age as a time to be feared and despised**, devising myriad procedures in order to eliminate it entirely. While sharing little with the advocates of the early modern period, the recent anti-age movement clearly mirrors many of the beliefs of the longevity advocates of a century ago. Both groups not only **see old age as a disease to be eradicated** through injections and operations, **but also argue that the old constitute an enormous economic burden.**

So **lets say we find ways to improve health** (across all ages) and extend the years of good health into what we now consider old age.  Say I get to live to 100 years in my own home while being active.  Lets say my wife also lives long and we prosper together.

Depending on where you live the economic factors that come into play will be interesting.

[1] In the USA, longevity will be for the wealthy. (pay medical system)

[2] In Canada, expensive longevity treatments will be very slow to be adopted  (covered) by our medical system.  It will be private clinics that focus on longevity, and not covered by public or private medical insurance.

**This will create quite a divide between the wealthy and the poor** as I live to be 100, and amass wealth (simply by investing and being old) and now my grandchildren and great grand children have the ""rich grampy"" giving them many financial incentives (pay for university etc.)

Stable marriage partnerships (failed marriage is one of the biggest correlations to childhood poverty [source](https://www.npr.org/2012/09/13/161017580/can-marriage-save-single-mothers-from-poverty))

&gt;Newly released census figures show a long-standing and glaring contrast: A third of families headed by single mothers are in poverty, and they are four times more likely than married-couple families to be poor. 

The changes in society will be drastic, even by a 20 year increase in lifespan.

I'm 55, and can start taking out money from my (defined contribution) pension plan now.  Should I?  

I'm in good health, and expect to work until I am 80, but will start taking my government pension at age 60 (earliest possible age) and investing that income so it will be in my hands, and not subject to changing rules of government.

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. 

&gt;**This review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging** in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. 

&gt;These hallmarks are: **genomic** instability, **telomere** attrition, **epigenetic** alterations, **loss of proteostasis**, deregulated **nutrient-sensing**, **mitochondrial dysfunction**, **cellular senescence**, **stem cell exhaustion**, and altered **intercellular communication**.

&gt; A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contribution to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging with minimal side-effects.

**Predictors of Tooth Loss in Two US Adult Populations**

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Objectives: This study determines tooth loss rate over a 1 O-year period and
identifies predictors of tooth loss in two separate US adult longitudinal study
populations. 

&gt;Methods: Subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging
(BLSA), consisting of 47 men and 47 women, ages ranging from 30 to 69 years,
were compared to subjects from the VA Dental Longitudinal Study (VADLS) in
Boston, MA, consisting Of 481 men in the same age range. Baseline and follow-up
examinations were performed on each cohort over a 10-year period. Using
multivariate regression models, significant predictors of tooth loss were identified.


&gt;Results: A mean rate of tooth loss of 1.5 teeth lost per 10 years was noted in the
VADLS cohort compared to 0.6 teeth lost per 10 years in the BLSA (Pe.001).

&gt;Combining subjects from both populations, significant predictors of tooth loss
were baseline values of: percent of teeth with restorations, mean probing pocket
depth score, age, **tobacco** use, **alcohol** consumption, number of teeth present,
and male sex. However, the set of significant predictor variables differed between
the two populations and sexes. In BLSA men, number of teeth present, percent
of teeth with restorations, mean probing pocket depth score, and alcohol consumption,
but not age, were significant, while in BLSA women, only age was a
significant predictor. Conclusions: Over a 10-year period, the incidence of tooth
loss, the rates of tooth loss, and the predictors of tooth loss were found to vary by
population and by sex. **These results illustrate the limits of generalizing tooth loss
findings across different study cohorts and indicate that there may exist important
differences in risk factors** for tooth loss among US adult populations. [J Public

,bzkpublic,"Not an easy question to answer considering we are talking of a hypothetical scenario here.

Let me approach the question from two sides:
* Can a person in his 90s even be reverted back to a significantly ""younger"" state? At least with the therapies which will come in the foreseeable decades? I'd have to say no. This is already an infinitely complex question if it has to be answered in full and would require hundreds of pages of reading and a lot of theorizing. 
So it's better to answer it vaguely - I believe (well it's more of a consensus actually) that there is a tipping point at which you would have so many intractable conditions trying to approach aging as a single problem at that point becomes impossible. And since we already know approaching it as separate conditions doesn't work, weeeeel ... I wouldn't bank on reaching 100 even if you take every therapy available at the time.

*In a theoretical situation in which we know everything there is to know about regeneration you would theoretically be able to morph back into a younger state and indeed even continue developing - not unlike any animal with outstanding potential for regeneration in nature. You would even be able to increase in body size and stature at ""will"". Regrow teeth. Basically you would be a shark.

There is the caveat that this is pure fantasy from the current standpoint of medicine. It's not entirely impossible, and there are examples in nature like the sharks I just mentioned, but achieving that level of morphological plasticity will require some serious engineering.  

What's being developed currently is more of a maintenance approach. I am not convinced it can significantly regress health and fitness to an earlier stage and I do consider full body induced cell turnover as proposed ELPI and the full SENS program when I'm saying that. 

Ultimately no one knows. We have to develop therapies. Test them on animals. Test them on humans. See how different individuals react to the treatments. If you're here for the feelgood answer - it's not impossible we'd be able to revert a human's bone structure, but I don't think anyone can tell you when.

Great article, and a very exciting discovery. 

I suspect this article would have been difficult to write, as the telomerase/ageing/cancer link is so complicated. 

On one hand we have doctors like Bill Andrews, Michael Fossel and (to a more cautious degree) Maria Blasco suggesting that telomerase upregulation in somatic cells will *reduce* cancer incidence, and on the other hand we have people suggesting that upregulating telomerase could be very dangerous. I believe Aubrey de Grey takes the latter view. And from your article, I see that you do, too. 

I find this chestnut very puzzling. Bill Andrews in this video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IdOezp79ZU is pretty explicit and obviously very confident that *telomerase upregulation does not cause cancer*.  Considering that he found the hTERT gene, I think we should take his opinion pretty seriously. And Maria Blasco is, of course, one of the world's leading scientists on this topic. 

Being as involved as you are in the community, you have a great knowledge of the current research and predominant thinking – do you feel that I've summarised the above accurately?

Clearly Liz Parrish (through BioViva and Integrated Health Systems) and Bill Andrews (through Libellla) are obviously very confident that telomerase upregulation in somatic cells isn't going to increase cancer risk, as it would be a disaster for their companies, and hugely unethical  (maybe criminal) for them proceed if they thought there was an increased cancer risk.

,ronnyhugo,"If we treat 4 of 7 you'd have virtually no gain in life expectancy (couple decades at most). But if you treat SOMETHING from every one of the seven types of damage, at regular intervals, health improves drastically and life expectancy skyrockets. 

The reason there aren't more than 7 types, is because there are more than 7 types. But they are treated or circumvented by the treatment for the 7 types. For instance, shortening of telomeres is certainly one aging process but it will be treated by apoptosis and stem-cells, which is the two treatments for two other aging processes. And that is pretty much how it goes with every other aging process people propose to add to the list of the seven SENS approaches. 

Besides that, there really aren't more to go wrong. There's cells and stuff between cells (the protein matrix). So cells can either divide too much (cancer), stop functioning (senescent), divide too little (loss of cells). And chemicals our cells can not digest can exist inside and outside cells (so that's two types of aging)(for example if you don't eat cholesterol its so vital the liver creates it, and some of the molecules oxidize and become versions of cholesterol that we lack the enzymes to digest, until we are given the genes that produce the enzymes we need to digest those versions). And then there's the protein matrix, it can only really form more connections over time (chemicals that make up the protein matrix is a bunch of sticky stuff, that's why the matrix sticks together in the first place or we'd be like a soup). So that's pretty much all the aging there can be. 

DNA damage (as in nuclear DNA not mitochondrial DNA) is so infrequent that its enough to cull the senescent or otherwise non-functional cells with apoptosis like we would for the entire aging process of senescent cells. Then replacement with stem-cell treatments based off of DNA from healthy working cells. That the healthy working cells also eventually have accumulated lots of mutations to their nuclear DNA that weren't there when the person was younger, is not important or relevance since the cells we chose to copy are fully functional nonetheless. There is no need to reverse every single change that occurs over time, we wouldn't for instance remove neurological connections that you accumulate ""just because a young person doesn't have any of those"".

PS: It also matters not why or how a cell becomes senescent or why or how the body didn't replace it by itself. We just force apoptosis of senescent cells no matter the cause of the senescence, and we just replace the lost cells no matter the reason for them being lost. We do not have to understand the near-infinite reasons why chemistry ended in this and that senescent cell. ",2,1519764329,longevity

I'm not studying biology, I'm just talking from what I've personally read over the years, and self-education, but as you study biology, you might understand this better than people who don't.

To me, the hypothesis of the 7 factors of aging makes sense, but we don't know if it will be enough to solve those to ""cure"" aging. It might be that there is something else that we missed, or it might be that ""curing"" some of those factors might actually do more harm than good, until we experiment it thoroughly, we just don't know.

That's even more of a reason to focus on this kind of research, because it will take a lot of smart and dedicated people to do these experiments that need to be done, and figure out what works, what doesn't, and where to go from there, so good luck to you, and I hope you decide to contribute to the field of longevity when you finish your studies.

&gt;but the whole idea of longevity escape velocity seems too easy. 

It does seem rather simple, but sometimes things don't need to be overly complicated to work.
I'm not saying I'm sure it will work, but it might, and we need to do research to find out if it does.

Also it kind of makes sense. As we fix damage on the body, it would make sense that you're able to live a longer, healthier life, so you'll have more time until the next, better treatment is available. Of course that's not a rule that will hold true 100% of the time, you might die at any time from a stroke, an aneurysm, or being hit by a car, but living longer would make it more likely that you would live even longer until the next treatments are available.

The ""longevity escape velocity"" is just a concept to explain this process of developing better treatments over time, that extend the life of people, so that there will be more time for those people to wait for better, future treatments, no one says that those people can't die anyway in the meantime, we just aim to reduce their likelihood of death, that's all medicine does really.

&gt; which will all be impossible to cure

I would never say something is impossible to cure. That makes logically no sense to me.

If we are alive and well right now, there is no reason why we couldn't revert changes that happen to us, to bring us back to the ""alive and well"" state that we previously were in. Sure, entropy happens, and information can get destroyed, but we don't need perfect information to maintain life, just an approximation of what we know is an ""alive"" state.

For example, if bone is broken, or a vein is teared, to fix it, we don't need to put atoms in the exact state as they were when the bone was whole, we just need a whole bone that serves the same function as the one that existed before, and a vein that contains the blood, like the one that existed before, as long as it works as expected, it's fine that it's not perfectly identical to the previous one, no violations of the uncertainty principle, or entropy are required.

You might say that this gets more complicated when talking about the brain and memories, and you might be right, but my argument would be the same, there is no reason why we can't just approximate to what we know works well enough, it doesn't have to be perfect. A slight memory loss would be acceptable, if the ""memories"" and ""personality"" in the brain reside in its ""pattern"", then alterations or ""fixes"" to it would probably cause some changes, but if it allows for longer and healthier lives, I think that's worth it.

&gt; And even if we cure suppose 4 out of 7 types of damage, wouldn't the other 3 that we didn't cure still render us dead since we only solved little over half the problem?

Possibly, but I imagine that solving even one of those, might make us healthier, and feel better.

[From the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey#The_seven_types_of_aging_damage), it mentions what curing each type of damage might help us with.

It seems to me, that even fixing one of those would be huge for our health, even if it doesn't increase our lifespan, it might increase our health-span, which is already worthwhile, but if it increases also the lifespan, that's a plus.

I do think that working on these might at least move us forward in the right direction in understanding what we have to do to cure aging, even if these don't happen to be the definitive solution, researching them will most likely help.

&gt; What I'm saying is would curing 4 types of damage really buy us 30 extra years, or will we still die to the other 3 types we have yet to cure?

Maybe, maybe not.

Maybe we just have to solve one of those to not die of old age anymore, but we'll still suffer the damage from the other 6. Or maybe we solve all of those, and we still die of old age. Or maybe a combination of these two options, or maybe something else. As I said, we really don't know, until we do more research to find out.

If I weren't a programmer, this would probably be what I'd like to do, it seems like there's a lot of challenging and interesting work to be done, but I think that I'll be helping contribute to the field too as a programmer, eventually, when I start working on AI.

&gt; do we really have any strategy to cure DNA damage? 

That's beyond my current knowledge, I'm afraid. I think to know more about that, you'd have to do some research of your own, or speak with researchers that are working on it.

I do have some ideas on how to do that, but keep in mind I'm not a biologist. 

Applying the ""divide and conquer"" approach, let's take this problem, and divide it in smaller steps.

First of all, I think we need to understand the DNA as best as we can, so we're able to know what each section does exactly, and at that point, we'll be able to know what's ""supposed"" to be there, and what isn't, so that even if we can't ""revert"" the DNA to what it was before it was damaged, because we have no information of what was there, we can change it to something that's healthy. So that's basically my hypothesis from above, even if we can't fix something as it was before perfectly, that's not necessary, as long as we make it work as it's supposed to.

For example, suppose there is a sequence that's needed to make antibodies.
We detect that it's mutated, and doesn't do that anymore, so then we change it to what it's normally supposed to do, so it does that again.

Now, doing that would be extremely difficult as far as I understand, since the DNA is so vast, that having people go over it, to find and fix mistakes, would be unfeasible.

That's where AI would come in. I think that's exactly the kind of mind-numbing, intensive, massive, and repetitive kind of work, and AI would excel at.

Basically, we'd train an AI to learn ""bad"" DNA sequences, then have it analyze a person's DNA, find all the mistakes, and then have humans go over them to make sure they're mistakes, and then fix them.

Not being a biologist, I have no idea how hard that is to do, and I'm sure it's easier said than done, but I know that at least the AI part is very much possible, and it can be done with current technology.

My point is that you should not think of anything as ""unfixable"", just because there currently isn't any fix for it. Even if what I proposed won't work, I'm sure someone could find other ways to do it, and figure it out.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I'd also love to have a chat with Aubrey, since he was formerly a programmer, maybe he could tell me if what I proposed could work too.

,revilodraw,"You're studying biology and I'm not, so you're more qualified than me – however I though I'd have a crack at answering. 

For starters, Aubrey often says that all 7 factors need to be addressed at once, otherwise we'll still die of whatever ones we don't address. 

You mentioned NAD+ and DNA damage separately, but didn't link them. But they are linked. Boosting NAD+ protects against chromosomal instability, which is why NASA was interested in it https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/health/unsw-harvard-scientists-unveil-giant-leap-anti-ageing

You mentioned that we have strategies for telomeres – I'm not sure if most people would agree with you there. Certainly we know how to up-regulate telomerase in mice, but we don't have a proven way of doing that in humans yet (due to ethics). However, I'm very interested in what Bill Andrews, Liz Parrish and Michael Fossel are doing, respectively, in this area. And I suspect that telomerase up-regulation will be powerful and beneficial, even though it's not in the SENS model. From Blasco's work and interviews, it seems that, if anything, telomerase up-regulation will be oncoprotective. Yet that remains to be seen.

You also mentioned reprogamming our cells to a younger state. I presume you know about Yamanaka factors, which are another exciting area of research. 

With regard to whether the SENS model is ""too easy"", I think that it doesn't really matter. The Hallmarks of Ageing is broken into 10 factors, and the lines are drawn slightly differently – but it's basically the same idea. My point is that all scientists and doctors would surely have to admit that it would be awesome for human health if we could address the 7 (or 10) factors.

**On a side note, Bill Andrew yesterday put on Facebook that he's on his way to Cartagena, Colombia, which is where Liz Parrish received her two gene therapies (hTERT and follistatin). I suspect this means that Libella Gene Therapeutics are about to start treating patients. If so, I think that's very exciting.

And as an addendum to that... Just because you pick one path does not limit your options. I'm a scientist but I also work for a biotech startup doing business development. The point in my mind is that scientists should be entrepreneurs or, at the very least, work closely with them to commercialize the biotechnologies and pharmaceuticals they create in the lab. We need people who can work the industry side of things from a business perspective.

Furthermore, we need people who can advocate for longevity research both for funding and political purposes. We should be using public outreach to inspire others to join this field and contribute monetarily to it. When a disease becomes interesting to the public, you see scientists rush to study it and money flows the right way. People like yourself can become the advocates that set that wheel spinning.

Here's how I see it as someone with a biology degree and a career in AI related software: many discoveries in the biotech space, especially those related to rejuvenation technology, are fundamentally bound by physical things like the pace of cell growth, and the slower speed of biological processes in general. 

Meanwhile certain classes of technological advancement, especially in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, are far less constrained by time. Instead creativity and ingenuity on the part of the researcher are what determine the pace of improvement. In many ways someone doing research in the software space is constrained only by their ability to accurately describe their idea in code. And although it may be slowing down, the pace of technological advancement has very closely followed Moore's law, so at least we can say its growth is consistent. 

""But wait"" I hear you exclaim, ""biology has the analogous [Carlson Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlson_curve) describing the decline in price of DNA sequencing!"" and you're right. However it's hard to say whether the decreased cost of DNA sequencing has the same effect on biotech research as doubling transistor density does on tech research. Doubling the power of a general purpose computing device is not at all the same as making a string of nucleotides cheaper to read.

Each field has its advantage over the other, and of course there's some real heavy overlap, but I think in the next 10 years we'll be surprised by what advances in nanotech and neuro-science will have enabled. I'm already surprised by the two research summaries I linked above.

,jimofoz,"Posted this comment on Fightaging.org’s piece on this, but I’ll repost it here – basically it may be necessary to rejuvenate the fibrosis in the lymph nodes as well as rejuvenating the thymus:

Janko Nikolich-Zugich, who presented at the SENS 5 conference, recently got a 10 million grant to rejuvenate the Thymus, however he thinks it will also be necessary to rejuvenate the lymph nodes:

https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/ua-lab-seeks-holy-grail-gerontology

“Although T-cells still enter the lymph system in older people, the scant T-cells that are produced can’t readily enter the lymph nodes. “The reason for that is the lymph nodes are undergoing profound changes with aging,” Nikolich-Zugich says.

In fact, researchers see a lot of fibrosis in the lymph node, meaning the connective bundles are starting to get thicker, less organized and less flexible.

“Lymph nodes aren’t able to effectively call in the cells from the outside, so fewer cells arrive,” he says. “Moreover, when the cells arrive, they don’t move inside like they should. Inside the lymph node is a superhighway meshwork, and we have found that this really gets messed up in aging.”

Scientists have tried rejuvenating only the thymus by blocking the body’s androgen production to increase its T-cell production, but increased, long-lasting immunity has proved elusive for the very reason that T-cells can’t gain entrance to the lymph nodes.

So, Nikolich-Zugich and his collaborators are formulating a novel plan of attack.

“There is one important part of this grant that is different from the approaches that people have been taking from the past,” Nikolich-Zugich says. “The novel idea here is that we want to rejuvenate both the thymus and the peripheral lymph organs, so both the factory that makes the cells and sites where the T-cells go to do the real work of defense against infection can once again work together.

“We feel like we will never get to rejuvenation if we work only on the thymus.”

In fact, the grant, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, is a program project grant, which by design includes several interrelated individual projects, each run by Nikolich-Zugich and his collaborators. Some of the projects look at the thymus, others at the lymph nodes.”",6,1518253612,longevity

It's a really questionable phrase to say that we have ever *cured* cancer in humans.  There's a good reason doctors say it is 'in remission'.  We kill the cancer, which I would argue is not the same.  Cancer is when cells become broken and do not automatically kill themselves or signal for degradation.  They divide and divide as much as they can.  A cell is an extremely complicated machine and there are many, many different ways that a cell can develop into a cancerous one.

The reality is that you always have cells that are developing into cancerous cells, and the natural checks in your cells stop this from developing into a full blown cancer (along with immune help if necessary).  As you get older, and your cells divide more, mistakes can be made while copying, like a game of telephone.  These checks to prevent cancer can break down,  and you can end up with a cancer that your body can no longer handle.  That's when a tumor forms and you go to the doctor and they put you on chemo or whatever and you go into remission and you think ""Yay! I'm cured!"".  You're not.  One cell (or group of cells) got to the point where your body could no longer handle it, but the rest of your body was also aging alongside that one cell and it's literally just a matter of time before the rest of those cells get to the point that the original cancer was and start their own cancers.

It's more akin to amputating an arm because you have flesh eating disease on your hand than it is to curing the disease causing it.  The real cure to cancer would be to look at genetic (and probably also epigentic and proteomic) health of the cells in your body, and be able to modify the genes to fix problems that arise.

Privilege. Longevity is very much tied to privilege. Privileged people don't just have better longevity, they have better health outcomes overall. The question is --what is privilege? It's highly subjective. You might be kidding yourself about your perceived privilege but if you believe it's true basically it is so it's a state of mind. 

So if you feel you are alone because you are being ostracized or that you are somehow lacking in privilege that will almost certainly have a negative influence on your well being. It's a completely different thing to believe that you have solitude due to respect, deference from peers and high status then it's certainly not going to hurt you. The really strange thing about all this is that it's really in your head. One person's measure of privilege can have little to do with another's. For instance, in many traditional African aboriginal cultures a man with no cattle is lacking in privilege. Such measures mean nothing but a curious bit of ethnographic trivia to a person in Los Angeles who thinks that privilege is a large house on the coast. ",2,1516271534,longevity

http://www.sens.org/research/research-blog/tale-telomerase-lessons-and-limits-late-life-launch

tl;dr - trying to adjust telomerase is messing with metabolism, and it will be far far easier to repair the fundamental 7 classes of aging damage rather than try and safely adjust metabolism:

""And dependence on telomerase expression to maintain aging cells in better health would place place recipients of telomerase therapy into a terrible dilemma. Irrespective of what transgenic telomerase therapy would in itself do to recipients' risk of cancer, it is incompatible with the sole foreseeable means of putting an irreversible end to cancer as a cause of age-related death and suffering. As explained in detail elsewhere,(14-16) the relentless evolutionary ingenuity of cancer as a disease leaves each of us at perpetual risk of cancer -- and will leave us at progressively greater risk of cancer as a cause of death as other drivers of age-related mortality are eliminated by emerging rejuvenation biotechnologies -- until all telomere-lengthening machinery is ablated from human cells. Any therapy that relies upon, or introduces, telomerase activity in human cells in situ is therefore incompatible with the goal of building an impregnable wall against neoplastic disease, whatever the merits of telomerase therapy as a standalone intervention.

Building on a decade of prior work, each study following logically from the last, this new report from Blasco's group at CNIO reveals telomerase therapy as a surprisingly wide-ranging intervention against the age-related slide into frailty and, perhaps, mortality. Much has been learned in the process, even if it is never turned into a human therapy. And more broadly, it demonstrates once again -- as with other legacy ""anti-aging"" therapies based on modulation of metabolic pathways -- that this degeneration is a modifiable target of biomedical intervention. Our bodies become plagued with ill health with age because of the progressive accumulation of cellular and molecular damage in our tissues. Retard that damage's accumulation (as in this study), and the body's slide into disability, dysfunction, and disease is retarded. Repair the damage of aging directly -- restore the structural integrity of aging cells and tissues to the molecular fidelity of youth -- and the health and vigor that characterizes youth will be restored, and maintained into an indefinite tomorrow.""",6,1515724859,longevity

'Adults in the 50 to 65 group who reported a high protein intake had a 75% increase in overall mortality and were 4 times more likely to die from cancer during the following 18 years than those in the low protein group. The moderate-protein diet was associated with a 3-fold increase in cancer mortality compared to the low-protein diet.

These associations—which were adjusted for numerous factors including smoking, waist circumference, and chronic conditions—weren’t altered when the percentage of calories from fat or carbohydrate were considered. However, the associations were only found when the proteins were derived from animal, rather than plant, sources.'

What you have to keep in mind is that cancer and ageing are directly linked (my PhD supervisor who is a biogerontologist did a lecture where he started off by saying that probably half the people in the room would die of cancer because we are living longer and longer and DNA damage accumulates as we age more), and to increase longevity we need to find ways to stop ageing-related illnesses like Alzheimer's and cancer, which is what tends to kill old people along with heart failure. 

The scientist in me finds it prudent to note that it's not as simple correlation as we'd like. The same study notes that in older people (65+) higher protein consumption didn't seem to increase the risk of cancer:

'Protein Consumption Linked to Longevity



 Senior couple enjoying a meal at home.
A high-protein diet during middle age was associated with higher mortality in a new study. In adults over 65, however, a high-protein diet was linked to lower mortality.

Calorie restriction increases longevity in many animals. It’s not known, however, if restriction works by lowering calorie intake or by reducing the intake of protein or other nutrients. A team led by Dr. Valter Longo at the University of Southern California set out to explore the link between dietary protein and mortality. The study was funded in part by NIH’s National Institute on Aging (NIA).

The researchers analyzed information on more than 6,800 U.S. adults, ages 50 and over, from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a periodic health and nutritional survey of the U.S. population. The researchers linked the survey data with National Death Index data, which provides the timing and causes of death. Results were published on March 4, 2014, in Cell Metabolism.

Participants were categorized into 3 groups based on the percent of self-reported calorie intake that came from protein: high (20% or more), moderate (10-19%), or low (less than 10%). They were further split into 2 age categories: 50 to 65, and 66 and older.

Adults in the 50 to 65 group who reported a high protein intake had a 75% increase in overall mortality and were 4 times more likely to die from cancer during the following 18 years than those in the low protein group. The moderate-protein diet was associated with a 3-fold increase in cancer mortality compared to the low-protein diet.

These associations—which were adjusted for numerous factors including smoking, waist circumference, and chronic conditions—weren’t altered when the percentage of calories from fat or carbohydrate were considered. However, the associations were only found when the proteins were derived from animal, rather than plant, sources.'

However, high protein consumption still led to other issues at age 65+:

'Conversely, in participants ages 65 and older, those who consumed high amounts of protein had a 28% lower risk of dying from any cause and a 60% lower risk of dying from cancer. These associations weren’t influenced by whether the protein was derived from animal or plant sources.'

And the findings were verified in mice:

'Mouse studies confirmed the effects of high protein intake. Mice fed a higher protein diet had increased progression of breast and melanoma tumors than those fed a lower protein diet. The low-protein diet, however, had detrimental effects in very old mice. The link between diet and longevity appeared to be moderated by a pathway involving insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).'

Alzheimer’s disease is a common and devastating disease characterized by aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide.
However, we know relatively little about the underlying molecular mechanisms or how to treat patients with Alzheimer’s
disease. Here we provide bioinformatic and experimental evidence of a conserved mitochondrial stress response signature
present in diseases involving amyloid-β proteotoxicity in human, mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans that involves the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitophagy pathways. Using a worm model of amyloid-β proteotoxicity,
GMC101, we recapitulated mitochondrial features and confirmed that the induction of this mitochondrial stress response
was essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis and health. Notably, increasing mitochondrial proteostasis
by pharmacologically and genetically targeting mitochondrial translation and mitophagy increases the fitness and lifespan
of GMC101 worms and reduces amyloid aggregation in cells, worms and in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s
disease. Our data support the relevance of enhancing mitochondrial proteostasis to delay amyloid-β proteotoxic diseases,
such as Alzheimer’s disease.",4,1512669471,longevity

,subsonictax,"The issue of justice and equity is commonly raised when arguing against life-extension. Of course it is impossible to predict the price a fictitious cure for aging would have. From experience, we know that a number of medical breakthroughs are not immediately available to everyone. The early antibiotics were available only to an elite and a number of present technologies, such as CAT scans and heart transplants, are not available to everyone. That is not a reason for us to ban pacemakers or regenerative medicine. We do not deny heart transplants just because they are not accessible to everyone. We cannot deny health and life just because some people lack healthcare. Besides, even if curing aging is initially expensive, with mass production one can speculate that it will eventually be available to everyone at affordable prices, at least in industrialized nations. This at least is the general trend in other medical breakthroughs of widespread appeal. In this context, it is important to mention that age-related diseases are now becoming the leading causes of death in Third World countries, so aging is not a problem limited to wealthy nations. It is also important to keep in mind that curing aging will likely also be incremental rather than a single breakthrough, as discussed elsewhere.

,Septuagint,"Hi. I did my PhD in public health genomics, where I systematically researched genetic testing companies. Clinical validity (i.e. the accuracy with which a test can predict a condition) varies enormously across the types of tests. 

At the moment, what these companies are really good at is identifying carrier status for recessive monogenic disorders, like cystic fibrosis and hemoglobinopathies. (NB: Carrier screening tests are useful in pregnancy planning and, outside of few exceptions, have no health implications for the tested individual) Some companies, like Counsyl and Natera screen for hundreds of these disorders with very high clinical validity, identifying 2-3% of reproductive couples as being at risk of having an affected child. 23andMe has voluntarily subjected itself to stricter regulations by obtaining an FDA clearance for its carrier test and only screens for about 45 disorders, identifying &lt;1% of couples as being at risk, but it's clinical validity is even higher. (i.e. almost no false positive results, while in case of Counsyl and Natera a small number of couples will false be identified as being at risk). Carrier screening is useful for anyone considering pregnancy, because due to the recessive nature of these disorders, more than 80% of at-risk couples do not have any personal or family history for the disease.  

Predictive genetic testing

1) A handful of autosomal recessive disorders are late-onset, meaning that testing for them could identify affected (but still asymptomatic) individuals. These tests could be useful due to their high clinical validity, but also have major disadvantages. For example, finding out that you'll develop blindness within the next 20 years will likely affect the quality of your life already today, long before the symptoms appear, without giving you much medically actionable information. - such tests are not available in a direct-to-consumer fashion.  
2) Testing for autosomal dominant disorders, like Huntington's, BRCA-related breast cancer, and several other types of cancer is also highly accurate, but makes little sense in the absence of the family history. Here, unlike recessive disorders, the condition runs in the family and must have already manifested somewhere. These tests are usually performed under strict medical supervision. 
3) For polygenic and multifactorial disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and most types of cancer, the clinical validity is low. Due to the complex interplay of environmental and genetic (most of which are yet to be discovered) factors, these tests cannot provide  high accuracy. The FDA and other regulators worldwide have cracked down on many providers of such tests (including 23andMe back in 2013), given that these tests are still very inaccurate and may result in real harm. For example, a poorly informed consumer may decide to undergo unnecessary or potentially harmful medical interventions based on inaccurate results.
-N.B. 23andMe has since improved the clinical validity of its service and no longer includes this useless stuff -

Pharmacogenomic testing (i.e. optimizing pharmacological treatment based on one's genetic profile): works, but in combination with medical history, and primarily in those patients who have not been responding to a treatment, or have been exhibiting major side-effects. Has to be medically indicated.

Lifestyle and sports-related testing: also has low clinical validity. Only a handful of genetic variants have been correlated with physical performance, and their impact is modest at best. However, there is also very little harm in taking this test. 

Nutrigenomics. (i.e. optimizing diet based on genetic profile) This one I'd specifically caution against. Not only is the accuracy of these tests very low, one study showed that the vast majority of companies in the nutrigenomic testing industry were receiving funding from the providers of shady dietary supplements. Needless to say, the results of such tests would say that you needed to optimize your diet by taking supplement XYZ, which was sold by their associate dealer.

Ancestry testing and recreational genomics - fun and generally accurate, but has no medical value.

In short, beyond single-gene disorders (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked), and outside diagnostic medical context, predictive power of most genetic tests is rather low. The two types of tests I'd strongly recommend against are nutrigenomic testing and predictive testing for multifactorial diseases",7,1511473707,longevity

&gt;In the past century,
;
30 y have been added to human life
expectancy. The result is a globally aging population that, al-
though rich in opportunities, also presents important challenges.
Governments, agencies, institutions, and families will be faced
with a scenario in which nutrient requirements for older persons
are not a passing thought but a stark reality.


&gt;A primary concern of many aging persons and their caregivers
is mobility. Declines in physical mobility are critical because they
are strongly aligned with the risk of d
isability, cognitive impairment,
institutionalization, falls, and mortality (1). As a well-developed
paradigm, a nutritional focus in aging has deservedly been on
bone health to prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis (2). In con-
trast to a fracture, however, there is a lack of a well-defined
clinical endpoint for the decline and loss of function of skeletal
muscle or what we now call sarcopenia. And yet, like bone,
skeletal muscle mass and function are immanently modifiable.
Analogous to bone, skeletal muscle is mechanically sensitive
and is stimulated to turn over, favoring net accretion, with load-
ing. Dietary protein has also been shown to be a modifiable
dietary factor that, when consumed at higher-than-recommended
(i.e., the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 0.8 g
·
kg
2
1
·
d
2
1
)
quantities, can abate declines in muscle mass (3). Critically, re-
quirements for dietary protein in older persons appear to be great-
er than those in younger persons (4). It has also been shown that
protein consumption at meals throughout the day can influence
muscle mass (5). Such a conclusion is in accordance with the
known dose-response relation of protein and muscle protein syn-
thesis (6) and results from shorter-term trials (7). In fact, inter-
ventions in which lower protein–containing meals have been
“topped up” with supplemental protein have shown increased
muscle mass in middle-aged persons (8).


&gt;In this issue of the Journal, Farsijani et al. (9) add an important
extension to their earlier findings from the NuAge cohort (5).
Previously, these authors showed that older (
;
74 y old) men and
women with evenly distributed protein intakes and men with
higher protein intakes had higher whole-body and appendicular
lean mass (5). Farsijani et al. (9) report that a more evenly
distributed protein intake across meals, independently of total
quantity of protein, was associated with a higher muscle strength
score in both men and women. Interestingly, a more evenly
distributed protein intake was also associated with a greater
mobility score, but only in men. What more evenly distributed
protein intakes were not associated with was the decline in
strength and mobility over 2 y of follow-up, a finding congru-
ent with a similar decline in muscle mass from the authors’ ear-
lier work (5). Thus, an emerging picture for protein and muscle
bears a striking resemblance to what has long been advocated
for calcium, vitamin D, and bone to attenuate the risk of osteo-
penia and osteoporosis: to accrue adequate bone mass and density
before age-related loss. Thus, older persons should aim to build
up as much of a functional muscle mass (homeostatic reserve) as
they can to provide a buffer against age-related sarcopenia and,
ultimately, age-related physical frailty. In fact, such a concept un-
derpins much of the narrative messaging around dietary protein
intakes, per-meal protein distribution, and age-related sarcopenia
(10). Importantly, impairment in physical function represents the
core feature shared by both sarcopenia and physical frailty. But
paramount is the recognition that sarcopenia, as a biological pre-
cursor of physical frailty, is immanently amenable to treatment
through both physical activity and, as Farsijani et al. have per-
suasively shown, higher and more evenly distributed dietary pro-
tein intakes (9). These observational findings shed vital insight
into the potential impact that per-meal protein recommendations
may have on skeletal muscle mass and function in older persons.
Farsijani et al. provide us with a demonstration that there are bona
fide functional consequences associated with dietary protein, its
per-meal consumption, and muscle mass (5) and function in older
persons (9). This growing body of evidence begs the question:
Are we ready to acknowledge that older persons have a greater
requirement for protein, as many have shown (4), and perhaps on
a per-meal basis?",9,1511359911,longevity

“We’re at the beginning of a paradigm change in medicine with the promise of being able to facilitate regeneration of parts of the human body, where cells and tissues can be engineered to grow healthy, functional organs to replace diseased ones; new genes can be introduced into the body to combat disease; and adult stem cells can generate replacements for cells that are lost to injury or disease. This is no longer the stuff of science fiction. This is the practical promise of modern applications of regenerative medicine,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “But this field is dynamic and complex. As such, it has presented unique challenges to researchers, health care providers, and the FDA as we seek to provide a clear pathway for those developing new therapies in this promising field, while making sure that the FDA meets its obligation to ensure the safety and efficacy of the medical products that patients rely upon. Alongside all the promise, we’ve also seen products marketed that are dangerous and have harmed people. With the policy framework the FDA is announcing today, we’re adopting a risk-based and science-based approach that builds upon existing regulations to support innovative product development while clarifying the FDA’s authorities and enforcement priorities. This will protect patients from products that pose potential significant risks, while accelerating access to safe and effective new therapies.”",2,1510940883,longevity

1. ""Just enough"" nutrition. Get a nurse curriculum book on nutrition, that allows you to calculate what nutritional intake you need for your age, gender, activity level, even many relevant illnesses. Any more nutrients than what you need is not good. That includes vitamins, more than you need has zero health benefit. In fact, many cancers live off vitamins, so super doses of vitamins have been shown to increase cancer risk (especially for men). PS: The only thing bad about processed food is that they tend to add a lot of fat and sugar in it, because that just means our brain thinks it tastes good. Its not bad in itself, but you easily exceed your daily nutrient intake with processed food. 
2. Activity. The body gets rid of anything you don't use. So if you don't use your brain, you lose it. If you don't use your heart muscle, you lose it. If you don't use your balance and coordination, you lose it. The oldest people are always those who have active lifestyles. They don't necessarily do cardio, but they will mow their own lawn, cook their own food, do their own shopping, walk their dog, clean their own house, etc. Activity is good no matter what it is, pretty much. 
3. Finish your antibiotics schedule, don't stop taking it when you feel better and have a few days left. Also don't eat poorly cooked food. 

Apart from this, no amount of vitamin pills or whatever, works. Activity is good, any activity. Just don't take too large steps, then you easily destroy joints and muscles (once muscle fibers are destroyed you don't get them back).

I think all of these things are far better understood than you think. You don't need to figure out every problem the human body can have and how to fix them to solve aging. Cell aging is very well understood, even how to ""fix"" it is well understood and techniques for implementing this fix have been demonstrated in lab rats already.  Most of the aliments that lead humans to die involve aging of cells and our bodies built in mechanism (apoptosis) for getting rid of cells that no longer function as they should. That is what cancer is, it's a cell that no longer performs it's function, but doesn't kill itself and keeps reproducing more bad copies. Some cancer is caused by bad copies of DNA in our bodies from aging cells, some is cause by DNA damage from outside sources. What we currently know, and can implement today could extend human lives by 20-30 years. Human trials of this medical technology is slated to begin in a few years.

One of the simplest and most promising (as far as near future timelines are concerned) are stem cells.  Simply injecting stem cells around the hypothalamus can have anti aging effects that can extend life by 10%.  A single injection can give you an extra 7.9 years on average. An injection of stem cells in the heart can result in extended life and the ability to exercise for 20% longer. This isn't a complicated, difficult to perform procedure. It's just injecting stem cells. How might several injections spread out at intervals affect life span and health? We'll know soon.

However, let's say I'm full of shit. We live forever and continue to have and increased birth rate. We'd have to make a choice now wouldn't we!

Raymond ""Ray"" Kurzweil (/ˈkɜːrzwaɪl/ KURZ-wyl; born February 12, 1948) is an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist. Aside from futurism, he is involved in fields such as optical character recognition (OCR), text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition technology, and electronic keyboard instruments. He has written books on health, artificial intelligence (AI), transhumanism, the technological singularity, and futurism. Kurzweil is a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements, and gives public talks to share his optimistic outlook on life extension technologies and the future of nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology.

Kurzweil was the principal inventor of the first charge-coupled device flatbed scanner,[2] the first omni-font optical character recognition,[2] the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind,[3] the first commercial text-to-speech synthesizer,[4] the Kurzweil K250 music synthesizer capable of simulating the sound of the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition.[5]

Kurzweil received the 1999 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the United States' highest honor in technology, from President Clinton in a White House ceremony[6]. He was the recipient of the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for 2001,[7] the world's largest for innovation. And in 2002 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, established by the U.S. Patent Office. He has received twenty-one honorary doctorates, and honors from three U.S. presidents. Kurzweil has been described as a ""restless genius""[8] by The Wall Street Journal and ""the ultimate thinking machine""[9] by Forbes. PBS included Kurzweil as one of 16 ""revolutionaries who made America""[10] along with other inventors of the past two centuries. Inc. magazine ranked him #8 among the ""most fascinating"" entrepreneurs in the United States and called him ""Edison's rightful heir"".[11]

Kurzweil has written seven books, five of which have been national bestsellers[12]. ",3,1510076779,longevity

His family will never suffer seeing him decay into old health and he is still able to be a productive member of society.  

Also, I reject the notion that just because someone is older, then that person has less of a right to live than anyone else.  That is the epitome of ageism.  Your right to continue living should have no bearing on how long ago you were born.

Your question also is not reflective of the bigger picture.  You can point to your individual instance and decry how I might favor an older person than a younger one but that is a red herring.  The impact is if we can turn back the clock 20 years for the 60 year old, then that affects *every* 60 year old on Earth and turning back the clock 20 years for *every* 60 year old absolutely results in a better outcome for humanity than saving every starving child on earth, it just does.

,ronnyhugo,"Short telomeres is no indication of biological age in the SENS school of thought. In fact, short telomeres will be an advantage because more cancerous cells will stop dividing as benign tumors before having time to get the epigenetic mutation which activates telomere-lengthening mechanisms (which allows cells to divide an infinite amount of times). 

If you want an indication of your health you should look for indicators in cancer risk. Because that is the big killer which, if you get it too soon, will mean you die even after SENS develops the cure for cancer. But cancer risk is complex because only 29% of cancers are due to lifestyle. 6% are genetic and the remaining 65% are bad luck, random chance. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1266 

But things which lower cancer risk (I invite you to google it and find papers on the subject, I'll just list some I have seen papers on): Avoid eating hot-dogs and anything fried high in calories (throat cancer and intestinal cancers especially), avoid smoking (obviously), avoid polluted air (wear a smog filter if walking or exercising for long periods in big city air, the tiny particulates from tires and diesel engines are the dangerous things not the CO2 or anything like that), avoid a high intake of processed food (its not that processed food is bad in itself, its just that there's usually a lot of added sugar and butter so the caloric content is high compared to if you made the exact same stuff yourself, and cancer is fueled by calories). 

Cancer divides very slowly because of various anti-cancer mechanisms within cells, which basically is the reason why cancer risk doubles every 5 years after 65. Its not that we get a lot more cancer, its just that cancer has had much more time to divide by that time so we finally detect it above 1 billion cancer cells (we have 37 200 billion normal cells so discovering cancer at only about 1 billion so reliably which is the case today, is a modern medical miracle). 

Being active is also a very good health tip. The common denominator among all old people above 90 is that they live active lives. They mow their own lawn, they cook their own food, they clean their own house, they do their own gardening, they do their own shopping, etc. Anything you can do to increase your activity level is good for your health.

&gt; In one of the largest microbiota studies conducted in humans, researchers at Western University, Lawson Health Research Institute and Tianyi Health Science Institute in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China have shown a potential link between healthy aging and a healthy gut.

&gt; The study, published this month in the journal mSphere, showed that the overall microbiota composition of the healthy elderly group was similar to that of people decades younger, and that the gut microbiota differed little between individuals from the ages of 30 to over 100.

&gt; &amp;quot;The main conclusion is that if you are ridiculously healthy and 90 years old, your gut microbiota is not that different from a healthy 30 year old in the same population,&amp;quot; said Greg Gloor, the principal investigator on the study and also a professor at Western&amp;#039;s Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry and Scientist at Lawson Health Research Institute.

I am not u/Toolian7 but I'd like to answer from my pov.

In my experience, everybody reacts positively on the prospect of getting 80 or 100 while remaining healthy. It lies well within the limits of imagination. The trouble starts when you claim things that go beyond. Many, if not most people do not believe that this is possible at all, or within their lifespans. Of those that do, many hold the well known objections.

I don't think it's possible to convince many people into support with arguments that stretch beyond layman imagination -- unless there's tangible proof. By proof, I mean things like -- Ray Kurzweil looking like 30 again and medical tests showing that he biologically is; or *treatments for their dogs and cats that make them stay vital for twice or more of their normal lifespan*. Only then will most people start to realize that it's really possible.

Until we have that, I propose to stay within the more acceptable claims when looking for support. When supporters turn 80 with health and looks of a 50 year old, they'll realize soon enough what ""staying healthy for longer"" means. And they'll love it, I have no doubt about that.

Because if not, it's a better investment for me to just spend what I have on improving the quality of the limited years I do have.

It depends what you mean by ""lower income"".  Not having health insurance in the US will make it harder.   But I do expect that everyone with health insurance should be able to get access very quickly.

I expect that the first company to develop some kind of effective regenerative treatments will immediately sell it to a billion people and make a trillion dollars.

A lot does depend on the details, of course.

Well, they are doing some trials.  I know Chromadex is funding some trials.  It'd be nice to have complete data about a lot of things, but in the absence of such data and with the constraints of time/funding, I think there are far worse things going on in this world.

Craig stated straight up stats. 1/3rd of men over 50 will not make it to 74.  20% of Women are in the same boat. Average life expectancy is just that... an average. Some will fall before they get old. That is not new information. Our DNA IS degrading on a daily basis. Life as a human is VERY unpredictable. Being human is a gloomy fate. You should feel uneasy every waking moment. That's actually the rational, intelligent response to being human.

The good news is they are working on fixing it. This science is now moving. We are making progress. Real interventions are less than a decade away now and there is a lot more in the pipe we don't know about yet. What Craig and Brian etc are doing is to start pushinbg this new idea in health care.

He's pushing the first rail of the new healthcare paradigm, prevention and early detection. If any of you are going to make it to LEV, you need to dodge what will kill you and for 2/3rds of us, its cancer and heart disease. What we should be doing is getting the regulatory bodies on-board with the new health-care paradigm. Treat disease via preventative means. 

He's doing good work. a little fear is good to motivate people.

Just remember that life is nothing more than a game of probabilities. Eat well, exercise, die anyway from a cancer. Its a crap shoot. Early detection helps skews the odds in your favor. Its not a bulletproof system... yet....So for now, better catch this while you can. Improve your odds of making it to LEV, its all you can do for now.... but not forever!

    - this includes health insurance, life insurance, and national health systems, who would be interested in subsidizing them should people not be taking them already

- the sheer rapidity with which a bunch of senolytic candidates have been developed, despite what is as far as I can tell trivial amounts of research effort &amp; funding, suggests that senolytics are easy to find so any high-priced senolytic will rapidly induce many competitors

Resveratrol - It’s gained a lot of attention for its reported anti-aging and disease-fighting powers. Still, it’s important to note that while experts agree that it does have potential, there’s still not enough data to confirm its effectiveness. Still, early research does suggest it might help protect you against:

Heart disease: It’s thought to help reduce inflammation, lower LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, and make it more difficult for clots to form that can lead to a heart attack.

Cancer: It could limit the spread of cancer cells and start killing them.

Alzheimer's: It may protect nerve cells from damage and fight the plaque buildup that can lead to the disease.

Diabetes: Resveratrol helps prevent insulin resistance, a condition in which the body becomes less sensitive to the blood sugar-lowering hormone insulin. The condition can lead to diabetes.

Researchers believe that resveratrol activates the SIRT1 gene. That gene is believed to protect the body against the effects of obesity and the diseases of aging.

,LockesRabb,"Instead of posting a clickbait video (seriously, had to go with a vague title?), how about actually posting a solid study (or at least an article linking to a study) with clearly outlined impacts?  Because this post was half-assed, I had to hit up Google to find out more on this.  After wading through a lot of clickbait hyped up articles, found two halfway decent articles that referenced a few studies:

- BBC: http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37229792
- CT: http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/ct-apple-cider-vinegar-health-20160326-story.html

I summarized it up below if you don't feel like wading through the articles. 

#####TL;DR:
- Reduces sugar in blood by 36% (if consumed prior to a meal)
- Has no significant impact on weight loss (if taken twice a day)
- No significant impact on inflammation (if taken twice a day)
- Reduces total cholesterol by 13% (if taken twice a day)

######Problems with the studies:  
BBC cited studies, but those had small sample sizes, and different consumption methods.  First study had people taking it prior to meals, second study had people taking it twice a day.  Short time periods of studies.  No data on demographics -- studies could be skewed if it was mostly men or women, or of a particular ethnicity.  Very little data on health baselines of samples.  They tested this on ""healthy"" people -- what about ""unhealthy"" people -- people with high total cholesterol, obese, and so on?  With CT, while they mentioned some studies, they didn't share the name (or even any identifying information) of those studies, so confirming whether those studies actually exist is problematic.

#####For those who don't want to read the summary, the articles, or do research, and don't want to wait for better studies (and better articles) to be done:  
Take 2 TBSP of apple cider vinegar diluted in 200 mL water twice a day to reduce total cholesterol.  Time it so you take it before a meal if you'd like to reduce impact on blood sugar levels. If that drink is still too hard to choke down because of the strong taste, try adding a little honey.  ***!!ALERT!!*** Apple cider vinegar is highly acidic, it can also damage your tooth enamel and esophagus -- so be sure to dilute it with water rather than taking it straight up as a shot. And because vinegar could interact with medications, and its anti-glycemic effect may be dangerous to diabetics taking insulin, talk to your doctor before using it therapeutically if these are concerns for you.   I'm not a doctor (nor am I qualified to talk about anything like this), so do take the time to talk to someone qualified about this.

#####Bonus advice: stop taking unqualified guidance from people like me, demand better studies, make decisions based on solid studies, or do better studies on your own to get better results based on solid data. Suck it up and start reading up good materials, your life literally depends on it.  Also, have an awesome day.  :)

That being said, here's the relevant summaries from both articles.

To see if there was substance to this idea we recruited healthy volunteers and asked them to eat two bagels, after having fasted overnight. We measured their blood sugar levels before and after eating and, as we expected, bagel consumption was followed by a large and rapid rise in their blood sugar levels.

&gt;The next day we asked them to consume another two bagels, but this time we asked them to knock back a diluted shot of apple cider vinegar just before doing so. Finally, we repeated the test a few days later, but this time we got our brave volunteers to gulp down some dilute malt vinegar before the bagel.
It turned out that the cider vinegar, but not the malt vinegar, had a big impact, reducing the amount of sugar in the volunteers' blood by 36% over 90 minutes.

#####CT had additional information to share in this regard:

&gt;Carol S. Johnston, associate director of the nutrition program at Arizona State University, who has been studying the effects of vinegar for more than 10 years, says, ""Vinegar appears to inhibit the enzymes that help you digest starch."" When starch is not completely digested, you get a smaller blood sugar (glycemic) response - ""20-40% less in healthy people and in diabetics"" - after eating a high-glycemic food such as a bagel, according to Johnston's findings. The vinegar has a more moderate blood-glucose impact when a fiber-rich whole grain is eaten (because there is less of a spike to begin with) and no effect when no starch is eaten.

#####Conclusion: Apple Cider Vinegar consumed prior to meal reduces amount of sugar in blood by 36%.

#####BBC study referenced to evaluate impact on weight loss, inflammation, and cholesterol:
&gt; We recruited 30 volunteers and divided them into three groups. Our first group were asked to drink two tablespoons of cider vinegar diluted in 200ml of water twice a day, every day, before a meal. The second group were asked to do the same with malt vinegar and the final group were given a placebo consisting of coloured water.

&gt;But what did Dr Brown's tests reveal? ""I'm sorry to say,"" he told his expectant audience, ""that none of you lost any weight.""

#####CT's article also supported this result:

&gt;Those undigested starch calories may also add up over time to some weight loss, plus, according to Johnston, ""there is emerging research that vinegar might increase fat oxidation."" She stresses, however, that contrary to many of those popular book titles, ""vinegar is not a magic bullet for weight loss. I have seen very modest weight loss in my studies, of one to two pounds after 12 weeks."" In the one study published, in Japan in 2009, that specifically examined vinegar's impact on weight, subjects lost just two to four pounds in 12 weeks.

&gt; As part of the testing Dr Brown had measured our volunteers' blood levels of something called C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation in the body.  Again, unfortunately, we didn't see any changes. We did see a small fall in the CRP levels of some of those taking cider vinegar, but it wasn't enough to get excited about.

&gt;In neither the placebo nor the malt vinegar group was there any change. But those consuming cider vinegar saw an average 13% reduction in total cholesterol, with a strikingly large reduction in triglycerides (a form of fat). And this was a particularly impressive finding because our volunteers were all healthy at the start, with normal cholesterol levels.

#####Conclusion: Apple cider vinegar taken twice a day has no significant impact on weight loss and inflammation.  It however has an impact on cholesterol (reduction of 13% in total cholesterol).

Another interesting aspect is how competitive fields would change. If we defeat aging, are we going to have football players with 200 years of on-field experience? How would that influence beginners? How many people would be up for 200 years of training just to catch up?

I know this link describes a ""conspiracy theory"" (it's written by the NY Times, however), but some time people and industries really do conspire against others.

The lipid hypothesis was/is one of the most widely believed theories within nutrition, but it was founded on a lie, and only in the past decade has the theory begun to crumble in academic circles. It still persists, however, and ""venerable"" groups like the American Heart Association (AHA) still perpetuate the theory. The AHA, in fact, just came out with a statement that coconut oil is ""just as bad as beef and butter.""
http://www.snopes.com/2017/06/28/aha-coconut-oil/

BTW, this statement was not prompted by any new research; they just decided to let the public know their feelings on ""BAD FAT"".

Simply put the lipid hypothesis can be broken down as the following:
saturated ( ""BAD"") fats raise serum LDL (""BAD"" cholesterol - lipoproteins are not actually cholesterol but carriers of cholesterol) levels --------- High LDL levels  CAUSE increased risk of coronary heart disease such as heart-attacks and strokes.

The first part of the equation is mostly indisputable; individuals who consume high levels of saturated fat from any source tend to have higher levels of serum LDL than individuals with a low-saturated fat diet. The second part of the equation- that high LDL levels CAUSE increased risk of heart disease- is an incredible case of displacing correlation with causation. 

I’m not going to post a million studies, but here are a couple articles that reference recent studies that showed no correlation between cholesterol levels and heart disease or all-cause mortality

http://www.nhs.uk/news/2016/06June/Pages/Study-say-theres-no-link-between-cholesterol-and-heart-disease.aspx

The worst part of the advice of avoiding saturated fat at all cost is that the foods people replace them with are often worse. Infamously, in the 1980’s the Center for Science in the Public Interest recommended that people switch from butter to margarine. Margarine at the time was partially hydrogenated oil and was very high in trans-fat ( nearly everyone agrees that trans-fat actually does have an extensive track record of harmful effects).
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/when-trans-fats-were-healthy/281274/

I’m going to cut this off since I realized I’m writing a book…  I’ll finish by saying that nutrition is a complicated subject and I think it’s best to review the research yourself and come to your own conclusions. 

-Don’t switch from whole milk to skim milk until you have reviewed some meta analysis (that show no benefits). 
-Don’t buy a “low-fat” item that added sugar compared to the regular item 

It’s never good to blindly follow authority figures, but it’s especially dubious to blindly follow the advice of nutrition experts when the field of nutrition is still so incredibly murky.

I'm not sure we can do much about that. 
Maybe if we move aging research to dogs and cats like the metformin studies ... people do extreme things for their pets. It might be easier to move lab research to the clinic if the patients are pets.

That being said, I'm surprised SENS needs funding still...

If you listen to his talks on it, it sounds like he's using CRISPR to do it all.. upregulate GDF11, myostatin, increase NAD, and use the Yamanaka factors to make our cells younger at a systemic level and then use Telomerase to cement the whole thing. 

Botton line, we don't know everything that's been going on in the labs. This ""Skunkworks"" project has been going on for some time.

,bzkpublic,"&gt;Olshansky says that the key point the study makes is that, ultimately, humans have an expiry date—even if future anti-aging interventions do manage to push that limit. “It doesn’t matter if [the age limit] is 115, 118, or 120,” he tells The Scientist. “The most important message to get across, in my view, is that we should not be trying to make ourselves live longer, we should only be trying to extend the period of healthy life.”

I will tell you why this is the wrong stance and we should do whatever we can to actively oppose it.

Health - What does health mean?
&gt;noun: health 
&gt;the state of being free from illness or injury.
What does an illness mean?
&gt;*a disorder of structure or function* in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.

But wait! **Is that the definition used by the gerontological community currently?**
To answer this question we need to look at their terminology, their favourite idea as of late - HEALTHY AGING.

Ok. Sounds good, right? Let's delve a tiny bit deeper.

What is the definition of aging?
&gt;the action or process of becoming impaired or inferior in quality, functioning, or condition

So let's look at this linguistic abomination they've come up with again:

Healthy - the state of being free from disorder of structure or function

Aging - the process of becoming impaired in functioning or condition

Let's combine them so you can look at this oxymoron in it's full splendor:
What is healthy aging?
&gt; *The state of being free from impairment of structure or function while becoming impaired in  structure or function*

So at this point it's clear gerontologists don't use the word healthy in the classical sense.
The semantic spaghetti they use instead is hard to define and will vary greatly from scientist to scientist and practitioner to practitioner - opening up the door for personal bias and interpretation. A problem which is already bad enough in healthcare.

So next time you're prepared to defend or promote healthy aging as an idea remember this - you don't know what they mean when they say healthy aging. At this point this whole focus on health has simply become an ideological platform for conservatism in gerontology.",11,1499322993,longevity

The human body cannot synthesize essential fatty acids, yet they are critical to human health; for this reason, EFAs must be obtained from food. Both αLA and LA are polyunsaturated and serve as precursors of other important compounds. For instance, αLA is the precursor for the omega-3 pathway. Likewise, LA is the parent fatty acid in the omega-6 pathway. Omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids are two separate distinct families, yet they are synthesized by some of the same enzymes; specifically, delta-5-desaturase and delta-6-desaturase.

My gut feeling is that the most dominant mechanisms of aging differ enough between humans and rodents that animal studies may not translate as well in this specific regard as in some other pharmacological areas.

My personal conclusion is that results will be highly variable and heavily based on the rest of your diet. As with most things, moderation is key. If you're taking omega-3 as an adjuvant therapy for an inflammatory disease or to correct a known dietary deficit it will probably be beneficial to healthspan if not lifespan as well.

,reasonattlm,"https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2017/06/arguing-against-the-appearance-of-a-limit-to-human-life-span-in-historical-data/

&gt;Today I'll point out the latest paper in a debate over whether there are limits to human life span. As everyone in the audience here is no doubt aware, human life expectancy is gently trending upward. Life expectancy at birth is rising at about two years with every decade, while life expectancy at 60 is rising at about a year with every decade. The evidence in support of this trend is robust, thanks to the enormous demographic databases collected over the past few decades. Is this trend approaching any sort of limit to human life span, however? Can historical data even be used to answer that question? This is a much more challenging proposition, as the available data for the oldest humans, the population of supercentenarians older than 110, is sparse. Very, very few people survive to these ages, to the point at which statistical methods operating on this data become ever more dubious with each additional year of age.
&gt;
&gt;Still, people crunch the numbers and try to extract meaning. You might recall that last year, Jan Vijg's group put forward their argument for the data to show there to be a limit to human life span over the years in which that data was collected. It was coupled to some unexpectedly pessimistic commentary on the future development of longevity science, given that Vijg has for some time been counted among those researchers openly in favor of extending healthy life spans by treating aging as a medical condition. The paper sparked some occasionally heated discussion. I don't think the researchers expressed their argument all that well in their publicity materials, and the popular science press then generated more than the usual degree of mess and confusion when they pitched in.
&gt;
&gt;So to the casual observer, it was a little difficult to see whether Vijg and company were making the obvious point, which is that human life span is effectively limited by the present level of medical technology, or whether some more subtle argument was being made. I think it is hard to disagree with the statement that medical technology determines limits to human life span. Where we can debate, given the sparse nature of the evidence to hand, is whether or not there exists one or more mechanisms of aging that have not been impacted in any meaningful way by improvements in medical technology over the past century, and which, on their own, can produce a very high rate of mortality in late life. That circumstance would look a lot like a limit when examining the consequent demographic data.
&gt;
&gt;One mechanism that springs to mind here is the accumulation of transthyretin amyloid, found in one small study to be the majority cause of death in supercentenarians, but which appears to have only a smaller impact on mortality in younger old age - it is implicated in something like 10% of heart failure cases, for example. Can we argue that advances in medicine and public health over the past century have had little to no impact on the accumulation of misfolded transthyretin deposits in tissues, and thus this mechanism acts as a limit on life span? Or do some of these improvements in fact produce an small, incidental reduction in amyloid burden in later life? I think that the evidence to support any of the possible positions on these questions is presently lacking.
&gt;
&gt;Whatever the state of effective limits on life span today, however, the limits on life span tomorrow are determined by progress towards rejuvenation therapies. There are treatments under development that can clear transthyretin amyloid from tissues, for example. The same is true for many of the other forms of molecular damage and waste accumulation that cause aging. Thus any debate over what the present demographics do or do not show is more academic than it might otherwise be. The natural state of human aging, already largely paved over by medicine, will be buried completely, made irrelevant in the decades ahead by the advent of means to repair the damage, restore youthful function, and eventually to indefinitely postpone all of the symptoms of aging.",10,1498695140,longevity
,WilderKat,"I was vegetarian for 20+ years (I grew up on a farm). I now eat fish on average 1-3 times a week. I too have concerns about animal welfare. When you do the math, meat consumption is pretty hard on the environment too.

Regarding health: I have never been able to find a definitive study citing that being a vegan or vegetarian increases lifespan, however, in studies I've read of groups of people that live long lives, meat consumption is low.

Doctors like Dean Ornish have promoted plant based diets for years. 

I do think people who are vegetarian/vegan tend to be more health conscious (although their are some that eat crap and only have plant based diets for ethical reasons). This probably skews research. vegetarians/vegans should be studied against health conscious meat eaters instead of the general population.

I do know there has been a lot of alarms set off this past year regarding cured meats. The research still seems inconclusive regarding red meat - some research shows it's bad. How meat is cooked effects how bad it is as well (charred meat, or meat cooked at high temperatures seems to be bad).

Calories: don't over consume. The best advice I've seen, stop eating when you are 80% full. It takes about 20-30 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it's full.

I haven't seen anything compelling regarding drastic calorie restriction and recently heard an interview with a doctor on NPR that said intermittent fasting doesn't work for humans. Personally I did intermittent fasting for a while and think it helped me gain a better understanding of when I'm really hungry. I was eating basically because I was on a work schedule, not because I was hungry. 

How we view eating matters. If your stressed out eating meat because of animal welfare, or if reducing calories causes angst, then most likely cortisol levels will increase and so will inflammation. Be happy with your food choices.

,Verzingetorix,"I have to be honest and tell you that you come off as someone who is ready to accept someone else opinion on something and run with it.

That being said. You do seem to be confusing some things. Caloric restriction, fasting and intermittent fasting. And I am going to focus on those things.

Caloric restriction (CR) in humans has not been tested. For primates it is inconclusive, some studies suggest it is beneficial, some show it does nothing. One common critique is that the apparent benefit in CR (in mammals, at least) is due it being compared to a *ad libitum* diet (all you can eat). Because eating excessive amounts of food is so detrimental to the overall health of the organisms being tested the ones under CR are made to look like they benefited from something when they might just be performing at baseline.

Various suggested mechanism of caloric restriction are related to regulation of sirtuin activity, NAD+, oxidative damage (redox stress) and a few others. Because CR as a lifestyle is rather extreme CR mimetics has been sought for quite some time now (because of money, lots of money). David Sinclair with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals bet on resveratrol. Now Elysium Health is marketing Basis, their NAD+ supplement. These and other naturally occurring substances, eating regimes (food types, timing, amounts, etc.), lifestyle choices are aimed at gaining the benefits of caloric restriction without having reduce your caloric intake drastically.

One of those mimetics is fasting, including [intermittent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNzZod_d18A), [fast-mimicking diets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PyyatqJSE), [time restrict eating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU)(links from Rhonda Patrick's talks). It intends to incite the same response as CR without the persistent low calorie intake which most people won't tolerate. Some people (PhDs, MDs and so) think you can get the benefits of CR (and other benefits) without having to to starve yourself for days and days. You might be able to fast a few days a month and get the same short term benefits, or 12-hour overnight fasting cycles every night.

NOBODY knows about the effects on longevity, there's zero concrete data on the long term effects of these fasting variations on humans. Nobody can truly answer you title question. But I want to bring something up: autophagy. The three links I shared above touch on it. It is know for a fact that food restriction up-regulates autophagy. And it is know for a fact that removal of old and malfunctioning cells from tissue protects the tissue and improves its functionality. Scenecent cells are pro-inflammatory, they could be precancerous and damage neighboring cells which become senescent themselves. Those things are a good reason to reduce your food intake in whichever manner suits your lifestyle best. Just don't risk nutrient deficiency. Keep in mind autophagy can also be upregulated by exercise.

Don't base your health and lifestyle decisions on reddit comments. Inform yourself, try a few things in a safe manner, use data to drive your decision (blood micronutrient assays, etc.) and talk to a doctor or dietitian as needed.",4,1498536468,longevity

,WilderKat,"Jack Lelane is my go to example for health. He had a great attitude and purpose in life which probably provided as much (if not more) health benefits as exercise. Strong will goes a long way.
As for weights, I agree with what's being said, muscle and bone diminish with age so strength training is important. Struggling to get around or be able to lift objects effects quality of life which in my opinion does determine how long one lives. If it's physical drudgery getting through daily life then that wears on a person. And yes, broken bones - especially hips- can hasten death at older ages.",1,1498528629,longevity
,WilderKat,"I've read several studies of large numbers of people and what seems to prevail time and again was one with a lot of fruits, vegetables, minimally processed foods and little to no meat (usually the choice of meat is fish). My doctor says to drink a cup of coffee a day (I've researched this a lot and it seems to show better health effects than green tea). 

When I read about people saying to stay away from this fruit or vegetable because of XYZ, I tend to tune out and move on. Unless a person has a specific problem/allergy with a fruit or vegetable, or a pre-existing condition that prohibits certain fruits and vegetables like kidney disease, then I think fruits and vegetables of all kinds are pretty healthy.

Regarding sweets: maple syrup and honey seem to have some health benefits. Refined sugars like cane sugar and artificial sweeteners seem to have pretty detrimental effects on health. Dates are also good to use in place of refined sugar.

Don't overdo salt.

My own personal experience: cutting out dairy had astonishing health benefits regarding joint pain. Dairy is shown to cause inflammation - although some people might be fine with it. It doesn't work for me so now it's gone.

From what I can also see regarding the research of people that live long healthy lives - they typically have strong social connections. I don't think just consuming healthy food is enough - it requires a balanced life.

Meditation, happiness and exercise help too.

,PrototypeModel,"I did look at the graphs, and the tables and charts, and all the words too. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5247583/table/t3/) is a table of the results for reference. 

I am not sure where you are getting these 3% and 6% numbers from. The best case scenario median life extension was in the female UW CR group where they lived 29.68 years average as opposed to the female control group that lived 23.86 years average. That is ~24% longer and if the same is true for humans, a female practicing CR could expect to get around 19 years with the median lifespan of 81 for women.

Now the above paragraph is complete bullshit because that is not how statistics nor science work, but I figured as long as we are cookin up numbers I would add mine to the mix.

&gt; the focus on of CR and CR mimetics shifted from lifespan a long time ago.

The monkey people don't believe that as of five months ago:

&gt;The tissues and longitudinal data stored over the course of these two highly controlled monkey studies present a unique resource that can be used to identify key pathways responsive to CR in primates, to uncover primate-specific aspects of the basic biology of ageing, and to determine molecular basis for nutritional modulation of health and ageing. Processes impacted by CR would be prime targets for the development of clinical interventions to offset age-related morbidity, and identification of factors involved in the mechanisms of CR will be pivotal in bringing these ideas to clinical research and human health care.

And the bottom line of it all is again:

&gt;Taken together, data from both UW and NIA studies support the concept that lower food intake in adult or advanced age is associated with improved survival in nonhuman primates.

It doesn't mean that you will live forever or even live to 100 or anything. It literally means that if you restrict your caloric intake to a little less than you would eat normally but maintain good nutrition, you will be less fat, less sick, and live longer than you would otherwise. At least thats true in monkeys and is very likely true in humans as well.",1,1498434357,longevity
,PrototypeModel,"&gt;To quote the UW you consider as the superior study

I don't consider it superior exactly, it is more recent and nearly doubles the available data while adding context. Both studies are important but analyzed together they paint a better picture. The UW study includes the NIA study data in its analysis.

&gt;So even in their own view effects on lifespan were minimal if at all detectable.

Yeah except that is not what they are saying. The quote you linked just states that improving healthspan is desirable outcome. It says nothing about the results. The result of the studies was that both median and maximum lifespan were extended by significant margins.

&gt;So back to OPs question - does his caloric intake impact his lifespan - the current scientific consensus is heavily weighing down on the negative

What consensus are you referring to? As far as I am concerned the evidence points towards a [consensus](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/a-discussion-of-the-effects-of-calorie-restriction/) of a probable small impact. 

&gt;Calorie restriction, reducing calorie intake while maintaining optimal levels of micronutrients, produces beneficial alterations in near all aspects of metabolism. It extends healthy life spans in near all species investigated to date, through this effect is much larger in short-lived species that have evolved a greater plasticity of life span in response to circumstances. **In humans the consensus is that it might make a difference of a few years to overall life span**, but it certainly greatly improves measures of health and lowers risk of age-related disease, suggesting the effect on healthspan is probably larger.

The NIA lists it as a topic of [interest](https://www.nia.nih.gov/newsroom/topics/calorie-restriction) and is working on human trials.

&gt; it probably doesn't impact his lifespan in any way as long as he is healthy as I already pointed out.

Caloric restriction is a way to stay healthy. Its not going to add twenty or even ten years to his life probably, but it significantly lowers incidence of hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other age related diseases and will therefore likely extend his lifespan.

A huge factor in this discussion is the age of the OP, as if hes young it probably doesn't matter at all as anti-aging therapies over the next few years/decades will likely be far more significant, and if hes older the few years could make a difference in surviving to LEV.",1,1498422999,longevity
,bzkpublic,"You are free to believe what you want but most studies showing significant, might I add, lifespan benefits to mice, flies and worms in most cases didn't have many more test animals than these studies.

To quote the UW you consider as the superior study:
&gt;Traditionally, an increase in both median and maximum lifespan was considered the hallmark of delayed ageing, and improvements in health were deemed to be a necessary and obvious component of longevity. The perspective has shifted somewhat towards greater emphasis on health and morbidity, **so an intervention that imparts improved health even in the absence of increased longevity**, is viewed as a highly favourable and legitimate example of an ageing intervention.

So even in their own view effects on lifespan were minimal if at all detectable.

So back to OPs question - does his caloric intake impact his lifespan - the current scientific consensus is heavily weighing down on the negative, it probably doesn't impact his lifespan in any way as long as he is healthy as I already pointed out.",1,1498414575,longevity
,PrototypeModel,"I really don't think that with only two major studies and less than 200 total monkeys studied anyone can say its really settled. If it were to be settled it would be settled in slight favor of CR.

&gt;Taken together, data from both UW and NIA studies support the concept that lower food intake in adult or advanced age is associated with improved survival in nonhuman primates.

From the discussion [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5247583/). Furthermore:

&gt;Importantly, the median survival estimates for old-onset males were very high, similar to what has been reported previously as the 90th percentile for this species (∼35 years of age). Six of the original 20 monkeys have lived beyond 40 years of age, the previous maximal lifespan recorded, and one old-onset CR male monkey is currently 43 years old, which is a longevity record for this species. Median survival estimates for old-onset females, ∼27 and ∼28 for controls and CR respectively, were also greater than national median lifespan estimates, with one remaining female currently 38 years of age.

The wisconsin study goes in depth into the differences between it and the NIA study and a major point is that the caloric intake of some of the control group monkeys in the NIA study is similar to the caloric intake of the CR monkeys in the wisconsin study:

&gt;Although an impact of CR on survival was not detected within the NIA old-onset cohort, comparison to the UW study shows that bodyweight was significantly lower in both control and CR groups of males and females than in their UW control counterparts, and was largely equivalent to that of UW CR. All males and females from the NIA old-onset groups consumed fewer calories than their counterpart controls from UW, instead both control and CR were closely aligned with food intake values of UW CR.

The NIA was calorically restricting some of its control monkeys.

To be clear, the main benefit of caloric restriction in primates is the lower incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, so all these studies are really saying is don't be fat and sick and you will live longer on average, which should be common sense to most people with a vague understanding of health and longevity.",1,1498411958,longevity

,bzkpublic,"It's a more complex question than you think.
The short answer is - we don't know, but probably not really.

Your caloric intake if you are a **human** in good shape, not overweight, physically active, not suffering from a metabolic disorder, etc - is most probably irrelevant. We can't be absolutely sure, but generally it won't affect your lifespan in any easily measurable way. 
Primate lifespan is not affected by caloric intake as far as we can tell. Thank the National Institute of Aging , they starved monkeys for 20 years for this knowledge. Or more appropriately thank the monkeys which suffered and died in our steed.

What we know is physically active adults live ever so slightly more than sedentary adults. That's about it, when it comes to exercise in general. Resistance exercise can increase muscle mass in old adults which technically makes them ""healthier"" but it doesn't seem to affect their lifespan in any direct manner.

Instead of considering what's in front of your eyes, maybe think about things lurking in the shadows. 
How is your regiment affecting your bones? What about your joints? What are the effects of your diet on your cardiovascular system? Things like these can have an effect on your lifespan and health further out. Maybe even a positive one.

,bzkpublic,"&gt; Neurogenesis will certainly give us a little bit of wiggle room with the brain, but eventually protein tangles and other forms of entropy will lead to minimal function.

A little bit of wiggle room?
Depends on how much of the ""entropy"" is the result of loss of neurons in the first place - adult neurogenesis in humans is minimal where it happens. After we remove protein tangles from the brain - which we are capable of doing already, not a surprise considering most of the research has concentrated on that - you'd still need to replace what has already been lost or damaged.
Neurons as far as we can tell do become senescent with age even though they are post-mitotic, meaning, we might need to actively remove neurons to promote brain health, which would require replacement strategies.
Generating healthy microglia is also important for any treatment of protein buildup because antibodies rely on a working immune system - so without the ability to repair the immune system of the brain we won't be able to repair any protein accumulation either. Not to mention the immune disregulation happening in aged brains irregardless of proteostasis.

As far as I can tell neurogenesis is by far the most important and most complex part of the problem. Any therapy that could repair the brain in it's entirety hinges on the generation of functional cells, both neurons and supporting structures.",3,1497829027,longevity

,GrabHerBootyBro,"Calorie restriction has been shown to be beneficial to primates however you need to consider why. From the literature ive read it seems to be because the BMR is lowered with caloric intake. So while it does this and many people lose weight while on a calorie restricted diet it is because their body cannot maintain its mass. The reason this may be negative is because it can potentially make you gain weight and harm the body when and if you return to a normal caloric intake because now your BMR will not go back up as quickly and it has i multiplicative effect on how quickly you will gain weight. So while it shows an increase in LE mice and monkeys it likely comes at a great cost and risk.  Including this you are likely to fail unless you get calories from fat because carbs burn quicker. As a last tidbit, you also have a complex system of hormones that require certain proteins and fats to create, lowering calories means lowering this which can also adversely affect health mood energy etc.

I think you're thinking along the right track with a whole foods plant-based diet, that seems to be particularly good for people with risk factors for cancer or cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc. I would prioritize losing weight the most, exercise helps and is good, but sticking to a good diet is the most important thing for losing weight.

Find foods you like that are healthy and plant-based. Indian food, thai food, and a lot of mexican food is actually designed to be mostly plant based so it actually tastes good.

With a plant-based diet you'll need to supplement with omega-3 dha and b12 as a requirement. Supplementing with choline can also be a good idea, depending on what foods you're eating.

It's hard to recommend stuff without being your doctor, but look into metformin if you're not already on it. That can help with high blood sugar levels and has the added benefit of being a longevity drug.

Also make sure you're circadian rhythm is in order. That means:

* In the morning get sunlight in your eyes
* Make sure to not get too much light in your eyes at night, or supplement with melatonin at the same time everyday (a minimum of 30 minutes before the time you should sleep)
* Don't take stimulants late in the day
* Don't eat for at least 3 hours before going to bed - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qlrB84xp5g",3,1496818498,longevity

,ahfoo,"Yeah, I'm always amused by people imagining they are extending their lives by being picky eaters or imagining that never having taken drugs or alcohol is going to make them last longer when even the cleanest air is naturally filled with free radicals. The longest living person in my family was my great grandmother who almost made it to a hundred and she died with a cigarette in her hand and a glass of scotch on the table which was how she lived her whole life and she was a very mean and self-centered person which made her longevity all the more curious. Longevity has little to do with fairness or righteousness. Perhaps it should be that way but it doesn't seem to be. 

I personally don't smoke tobacco and drink very little alcohol compared to most people I know and I try to limit my sugar and overall calorie intake as much as I can but I'm not kidding myself about these measures being enough to dramatically extend my life. They might make a difference a few years here or there but overall they're not that helpful for life extension as far as I know. That doesn't mean they're useless though because quality of life is a separate issue and I like to be lean and in good health during the time that I do have simply because I'm arrogant and self-centered like great-grandma.  

The planet we live on wasn't made for us in my own belief. As I understand it, we adapted to this planet as best as possible which means only partially and there is room for improvement. I doubt the idea that there is a perfect diet that we simply have gotten away from which will lead to excellent health and significantly extended longevity when the air itself is fundamentally toxic. I'd put much more emphasis on approaches that attempt to manage and repair the damage that we inevitably face than on avoiding certain foods. There is great evidence that our bodies have repair and editing systems as well as redundant back ups and if we could work on enhancing the work those systems already do it seems more fruitful than condemning certain nutrients. 

My two cents is that we'd all be better off with a wider variety of unprocessed foods containing all sorts of weird stuff but in much smaller portions than are considered normal in the US. I think we're missing a big trick by not eating insects and more varieties of exotic fermented and cultured products including more varieties of fungus.

Telomeres are the protective caps on our DNA chromosomes – the longer they are, the better for our health. Apparently, by having your telomeres tested regularly, you can find out more about your body and how it reacts to changes in your lifestyle, including exercising.

Talking about aerobic vs anaerobic, here is a research based on a 500 people survey https://titanovo.com/age-parenthood-sport-alcohol-influence-telomere-length/ It says that only anaerobic exercises are useful for telomeres.

If you really want to find out how aerobic and anaerobic exercises affect your telomeres (which means that it also affects your longevity), you should do regular telomere testing every 3-6 months to see your telomere dynamics.

,protoy,"I meant that it would be worth millions of dollars to the athletes.

I think you underestimate the willingness of athletes to risk side-effects, especially if the side effects would only be detrimental after their careers were over.  There have been many athletes dying in their 30s or earlier because of steroid use, EPO use etc. in the last couple of decades.  Failing a drug test would likely be the only deterrent for many if not most.

I'm also using the term 'antiaging' treatment liberally.  If you include things like stemcell injections we know that many top athletes are already openly leading the way in that area, including Rafael Nadal (who is currently making an astonishing comeback at age 30 after having his wrecked knees treated with stem cell therapies).

TRT, or simply testosterone injections, whilst illegal as a performance enhancer, might be considered an anti-aging treatment that is widely used by athletes to extend their careers.

I'd guess that there must be a few athletes taking things like metformin.

If some of these 'Golden' athletes were to go on record and say they had been regularly fasting or such like, that might be very good anecdotal evidence at least of their effectiveness.

BTW, how would you explain the greater longevity of athletes these days?

edit: ""The need to protect elite athletes from themselves is real. In surveys administered between 1982 and 1995, half of elite athletes said they would take an undetectable PED if doing so meant they would win an Olympic gold medal, even if the drug were guaranteed to kill them within five years. When that hypothetical was posed to 250 normal Australians, less than one percent said they would take the gold-then-death drug.""

We're all going to get sore backs and bouts of fatigue and some  abdominal fat accumulation as we age; the question is: do these things, mostly harmless in the long run, constitute a disease worth diagnosing and treating?

Notice that one key factor in reducing prostate cancer risk is frequency of masturbation with a higher frequency over one's lifetime associated with a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. Similarly, notice that brushing your teeth doesn't wear them away and actually is good for them. Flossing your gums can hurt if you don't do it regularly but it's highly advised nonetheless. Also look at vitamin D and sunlight. It's the repair process from having one's cells damaged by the UV that initiates the beneficial health effects.

,dpao,"&gt;To our knowledge, only 2 cohort studies have examined animal and plant protein intake in relation to mortality. In the Iowa
Women’s Health Study, although neither animal nor plant protein was associated with all-cause mortality, an inverse association was found between plant protein and CVD mortality, and substituting plant protein for animal protein was associated with a substantially lower CVD mortality. In a recent report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, higher
protein intake was related to an increased risk for all-cause mortality among participants younger than 65 years. However, when animal protein intake was controlled for, this association was eliminated, suggesting that animal protein was responsible for the effect of higher protein intake, if any, on increased mortality. Although a direct comparison of these studies is difficult, given the variation in the study methods, these data together with our current findings support the importance of protein sources for the long-term health outcome and suggest that plants constitute a preferred protein source compared with animal foods.

&gt;CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
High animal protein intake was positively associated with cardiovascular mortality and high plant protein intake was inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, *especially* among individuals with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor.

I've heard the argument that while vitamin C might diminish the returns from fasting via less ROS, very high dose vitamin C might promote ROS for a further health-promoting effect from the hormetic damage.

&gt;Caloric restriction has consistently been shown to extend lifespan and ameliorate aging-related diseases. These effects may be due to diet-induced reactive oxygen species acting to upregulate sirtuins and related protective pathways, which research suggests may be partially inhibited by dietary antioxidant supplementation.

&gt;To test antioxidant supplements, the participants repeated the diet but also included vitamin C and vitamin E.  At the end of the three weeks, the researchers tested the same health parameters. They found that the beneficial sirtuin proteins such as SIRT 3 and another, SIRT1, tended to increase as a result of the diet. However, when antioxidants were supplemented on top of the diet, some of these increases disappeared. This is in line with some research that indicates flooding the system with supplemental antioxidants may counteract the effects of fasting or exercise, said Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, Ph.D., co-author of the paper and chief of the division of biology of aging in the department of aging and geriatric research.  “You need some pain, some inflammation, some oxidative stress for some regeneration or repair.”",0,1492583137,longevity

&gt;Over all, this new review reinforced the findings of the earlier research, the scientists determined. Cumulatively, the data indicated that running, whatever someone's pace or mileage, dropped a person's risk of premature death by almost 40 percent, a benefit that held true even when the researchers controlled for smoking, drinking and a history of health problems such as hypertension or obesity. Perhaps most interesting, the researchers calculated that, hour for hour, running statistically returns more time to people's lives than it consumes. Figuring two hours per week of training, since that was the average reported by runners in the earlier study, the researchers estimated that a typical runner would spend less than six months actually running over the course of almost 40 years, but could expect an increase in life expectancy of 3.2 years, for a net gain of about 2.8 years. **In concrete terms, an hour of running statistically lengthens life expectancy by seven hours**, the researchers report.",4,1492550592,longevity

(Some background info if you don't know the guy.)

&gt;*""Steven R. Gundry, M.D., is a cum laude graduate of Yale University with special honors in Human Biological and Social Evolution. After graduating Alpha Omega Alpha from the Medical College of Georgia School of Medicine, Dr. Gundry completed residencies in General Surgery and Thoracic Surgery at the University of Michigan and served as a Clinical Associate at the National Institutes of Health. There, he invented devices that reverse the cell death seen in acute heart attacks; variations of these devices subsequently became the Gundry™ Retrograde Cardioplegia Cannula. It has become the world’s most widely used device of its kind to protect the heart from damage during open-heart surgery. After completing a fellowship in congenital heart surgery at The Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, in London, Dr. Gundry was recruited as Professor and Chairman of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Loma Linda University Medical Center. There, he and his partner, Leonard Bailey, pioneered infant and pediatric heart transplantation. Together, they have performed more such transplants than any other surgeons in the world.*

&gt;*During his tenure at Loma Linda, Dr. Gundry pioneered the field of xenotransplantation, the study of how the genes of one species react to the transplanted heart of a foreign species. He was one of the original twenty investigators of the first FDA-approved implantable left ventricular assist device (a kind of artificial heart). Dr. Gundry is also the inventor of the Gundry Ministernomy, the widely used minimally invasive approach to aortic- or mitral-valve repair, the Gundry  Lateral Tunnel, a “living” tissue that can rebuild parts of the heart in children with severe congenital heart malformations; and the Skoosh™ venous cannula, the most widely used cannula in minimally invasive heart operations.*

&gt;*One of the fathers of robotic surgery, as a consultant to Computer Motion (now Intuitive Surgical), Dr. Gundry received early FDA approval to use robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery for coronary artery-bypass and mitral-valve operations. He holds patents on devices for connecting blood vessels and coronary artery bypasses without sutures, as well as for repairing the mitral valve without the need for sutures or a heart-lung machine. He has served on the Board of Directors of the American Society of Artificial Internal Organs (ASIAO), and was a founding board member and treasurer of the International Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery (ISMICS).  He recently completed two successive elected terms as President of the Board of Directors of the American Heart Association, Desert Division.*

&gt;*Dr. Gundry has been elected a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Cardiology, the American Surgical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the College of Chest Physicians. He is a member of numerous other surgical and medical societies. He is also the author of more than three hundred articles, chapters, and abstracts in peer-reviewed journals on surgical, immunology, genetic, nutrition, and lipid investigations. He has operated in more than thirty countries, including charitable missions to China, India, and Zimbabwe.*

&gt;*Inspired by the stunning reversal of coronary artery disease in an “inoperable” patient, using a combination of dietary changes and nutriceutical supplements, in 2001, Dr. Gundry changed the path of his career. An obese, chronic “diet” failure himself, he adapted his undergraduate Yale University thesis to design a diet based on evolutionary genetic coding, which enabled him to reverse his own medical problems. In the process, he effortlessly lost 70 pounds. The equally astonishing results from following what he came to call Diet Evolution in several of his staff led Dr. Gundry to accept a position in Palm Springs where he could devote his efforts to disease reversal.*

&gt;*No longer satisfied with repairing the damage of chronic diseases, since 2002, Dr. Gundry founded and has served as Medical Director of The International Heart and Lung Institute in Palm Springs, California, which serves patients referred from across the nation. He is also Founder and Director of The Center for Restorative Medicine, part of the Institute. Its mission is to prevent and reverse the chronic diseases of “ageing” with diet and nutriceutical interventions, using surgical intervention for heart and vascular disease as a last resort.""*",1,1492488145,longevity

https://deniseminger.com/2015/10/06/in-defense-of-low-fat-a-call-for-some-evolution-of-thought-part-1/

There are good reasons other good reasons to eat carbs such as anti oxidant defense and hormone production and signalling explained by Chris Masterjohn, but mostly I do it these days because I feel better than when I was low carb.

That said, low carb may be best as a short or long solution for people depending on their medical condition (the most obvious of which is insulin resistance) and those conditions seem more prevalent in the modern world vs traditional settings. I think low carb should be used as a temporary fix until one can healthily eat a higher carb diet, mostly for hormonal reasons detailed by Masterjohn.

So obese people, smokers, alcoholics, and couch potatoes got a slight boost from lowering their meat intake and upping their veggies. 

""But not evident among those without any of these risk factors"". 

I don't think meat is the problem here and I don't think veggies are the magic bullet. The context is so much more important than the food being eaten. 

If you're already obese any food you eat is technically increasing your risk of health problems because the fact that you are obese means that your body is maxed out and running out of places to store energy. A 400 pound guy eating enough ""healthy"" food to maintain obesity is going to be unhealthier than someone eating ""bad"" food  but in great shape and with low body fat. ",2,1490909366,longevity

The mainstream being chauvinists is pretty obvious from the article. The so called healthspanners. I find it infinitely amusing how most of their work concentrates on compounds which do not compress morbidity but in fact extend lifespan and frailty in model animals.

They like to portray their research as the ""sane"" and rational side of the story but from the last 30 years what we've learned about lifespans is this - making an animal live twice as long - easy. Making an animal have a perfect health and then just drop dead - easy, as long as you put a bullet in it's head while it's healthy that is. Nothing dies if it's truly healthy - deciding on an arbitrary measure of health and calling the compound that has an effect on that arbitrary measure a cure (or in this case a geroprotector or whatever they want to sell metformin as) on the other hand now that works wonderfully! Let's ship a thousand pills with that philosophy!

The whole moving force behind the ""healthspanners"" is the urge to sell IPs to Big Pharma ad nauseum. That's about it.

,goncalogordo,"Fair comment, thanks. I did medical school in Portugal (small European country) but I'm not a practising doctor. Afterwards, I did consulting and investment management (strong focus on biotech and software) for 7 years. I've recently quit because I wanted to start a project in healthcare, and I always thought that prevention and early diagnostics could significantly improve everyone's health but were not explored well enough. Because of that, I've started by developing an app that I think can help people with prevention. First, you answer questions about 10 habits and it shows you what scientists have found regarding mortality risk of people that do a similar amount to yourself (e.g. that eat the same amount of nuts). It also shows you what was the amount associated with the lowest mortality risk (i.e. 7 servings of nuts per week) and what could be the benefit in terms of mortality risk reduction of changing your habit to eating that amount. Then it allows you to select which habit you want to focus on improving and to track changes over time. It also gives you a score that goes up as you improve your habits. The links for all the scientific research are included in the app. The studies were scientific reviews including at least 100.000 participants and done by different scientists and published in different journals. I use the app myself and already tested it with a group of 20 friends/family. I'm now looking to test it with a larger group of people that I don't know (feedback is generally less biased). If you're interested, let me know and I'll send you a private message with my email. Hope this clarifies it. All feedback is much appreciated. ",2,1490716221,longevity

##Importance##
Defining what represents a macronutritionally balanced diet remains an open question and a high priority in nutrition research. Although the amount of protein may have specific effects, from a broader dietary perspective, the choice of protein sources will inevitably influence other components of diet and may be a critical determinant for the health outcome.

##Objective##
To examine the associations of animal and plant protein intake with the risk for mortality.

##Design, Setting, and Participants##
This prospective cohort study of US health care professionals included 131 342 participants from the Nurses’ Health Study (1980 to end of follow-up on June 1, 2012) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986 to end of follow-up on January 31, 2012). Animal and plant protein intake was assessed by regularly updated validated food frequency questionnaires. Data were analyzed from June 20, 2014, to January 18, 2016.

##Main Outcomes and Measures##
Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

##Results##
Of the 131 342 participants, 85 013 were women (64.7%) and 46 329 were men (35.3%) (mean [SD] age, 49 [9] years). The median protein intake, as assessed by percentage of energy, was 14% for animal protein (5th-95th percentile, 9%-22%) and 4% for plant protein (5th-95th percentile, 2%-6%). After adjusting for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, animal protein intake was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.02 per 10% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.98-1.05; P for trend = .33) but was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.08 per 10% energy increment; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P for trend = .04). Plant protein was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.90 per 3% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95; P for trend &lt; .001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.88 per 3% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.80-0.97; P for trend = .007). These associations were confined to participants with at least 1 unhealthy lifestyle factor based on smoking, heavy alcohol intake, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity, but not evident among those without any of these risk factors. Replacing animal protein of various origins with plant protein was associated with lower mortality. In particular, the HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.59-0.75) when 3% of energy from plant protein was substituted for an equivalent amount of protein from processed red meat, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92) from unprocessed red meat, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75-0.88) from egg.

##Conclusions and Relevance##
High animal protein intake was positively associated with cardiovascular mortality and high plant protein intake was inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially among individuals with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor. Substitution of plant protein for animal protein, especially that from processed red meat, was associated with lower mortality, suggesting the importance of protein source.",7,1490681277,longevity

,mister_longevity,"Thanks for the well thought out reply. I should have been more clear with my post. Although I did not say it earlier, I was not implying that a low resting heart rate by itself will increase longevity even though the study I site below does seem to show it to be the case.

I don't worry about it but I do actively address the things that I can control. A want to go after the low-hanging fruit. Lifespan improvements are incremental. It is a simple cost/benefit analysis: I am willing to make lifestyle changes that are likely to increase my lifespan/healthspan if they are also very unlikely to shorten it. Likewise I will remove things that are likely to shorten it while being very unlikely to lengthen it.

You are correct in saying that there are people in apparently good health with low resting heart rates that die. A low RHR is obviously not protective of other problems.

,NotTooDeep,"Massive puzzle. Well said, that. I program computers so being comfortable with feeling ignorant and stupid is part of the job description. It buys me the time I need without wasting energy. It's also a useful attitude towards health.

I'm saying the benefit of exercise is real in a broad fashion, and will increase your quality of life. 

I'm saying, just as in car accidents, there are more ways than one for your heart to stop. A low RHR blocks some of those ways, but not all.

I'm saying, since the benefits of exercise are real, there is no need for creating a faith in correlation = causation. The logical flaw in that bit of wishful thinking is a distraction. It's more useful to stay focused on how you feel and what you can measure.

Which leads me full circle to my grandfather, who lived to 99. Simple man. Lifelong subsistence farmer.  

When his kids would try to convince him to move in with them in the city, he'd say that the air was not good; ""Too many breathed it already"". When the kids would complain about his kitchen faucet running out of water in the summer, he'd tell them to use less. He always ate from his garden and his small herd. He outlived the majority of his 13 kids. 

I think there's a healing quality to some lifestyles that doesn't exist in other lifestyles. I think this also depends on what parts of the gene pool you're from. So one person's fountain of youth lifestyle can be another person's poison. Again, using your words, it's a massive puzzle.

I've known a lot of athletic people. Some lived long, fruitful lives and some did not. I've know a lot of sedentary people with the same varied outcomes. I've known some morbidly obese people and they were barely living. Couldn't walk. Couldn't care for themselves. That's a disease state, not a lifestyle. 

Back in my youth, I worked in a hospital pharmacy and had the privilege of working on codes in the ER. I got to see people die. In the same week, a woman in her 80s came in and a man in his mid 40s. She was unconscious, frail as could be, and not breathing on her own. He was fit, was doing his evening walk of a few miles, and stopped in at a firestation to praise the work they do, when he fell over dead, clutching his heart. 

She had been unconscious for awhile when the paramedics arrived. They couldn't tell how long she'd been without oxygen. He was under professional care from the moment the paramedics caught him, preventing him from hitting his head on the pavement.

They pronounced her dead at the ER after going through the standard regimen of stuff and immediately after a nurse brought in her foot thick stack of medical records. Since it was a training hospital, one of the nurses asked the doctor if she could practice intubating her and he agreed. At some point during the nurse's practice, the patient took a breath. The patient walked out of the hospital a week later.

The very fit man never regained consciousness and died, but not after a very long and vigorous effort on the part of the staff.

My conclusion; long walks in the evening aren't really dangerous. Getting old isn't a death sentence. Not living as well as you can when you can is a crying shame.

One of the doctors said that some people seem to have a number of heartbeats at birth. This was in the 70s, so that was as valid a scientific explanation in my mind as any. I don't worry about it, though, because worrying can kill you.",1,1490550256,longevity
,cameraguy222,"I don't say I don't read them, I do. I'm saying I prefer to primarily read studies and peer reviewed reviews to draw my own conclusions. We agree that studies are biased. I'm trained to look at the raw data and judge if it was done right, short of direct fraud, it's possible to see flaws in experimental design and things that were not considered. You can't possibly say I am less informed because I don't read the sparknotes, but read the actual material. I am a LITERAL published scientist in this field. My interpretations and conclusions have passed scientific review. 

I agree on the telomeres cancer thing. I have said from the start, they are necessary for immortality, but not sufficient. Cancers need a lot more changes also. 

""Fossel agrees that telomeres don't cause aging. However, he believes that preventing telomere shortening is the best way to intervene in the aging process and therefore the most likely candidate for curing and preventing Alzheimer.""

That's kind of faulty logic no? If telomeres aren't causing glial aging, why would this intervention help aging? I patently disagree with this approach, I just don't think it is sufficient to help glial cells. I hope he can get it approved as a safe therapy, because eventually we will need to address telomeres along side any other treatment, I just don't think it will have an effect alone. This is all just my independently researched scientific view, you don't have to agree and I don't care if you do, but there is valid criticism to this theory. 

Populational selection is a whole different can of worms. It's generally not accepted, but I subscribe to the selfish gene theory (Dawkins, if you're not familiar) so I can see some mechanism for it to happen, especially in genetically similar groups like yeast. There are some good arguments for menapause being evolutionarily beneficial so that older family members can help raise grandchildren well. 

Wether aging itself is programmed like that post suggests, I don't think so, at least not in most cases. Aging is a poor way to control population levels. Look at rabbits or mice. They don't live very long, and their populations still aren't held in check by aging. They have the absolute ability to exponentially divide until they overpopulate, and most animals do have this ability, otherwise they wouldn't grow beyond their local environmental constraints. There is also the false premise there that if a population overpopulates, the species dies off. That is absolutely not true, worst case the majority dies, and you are back down to low levels. If anything this is a higher evolution driver, as hardier animals are the ones who survive. Besides, food cues are more efficient at population control than systematic death at a fixed timepoint. Predator prey population dynamics are very well studied by the way and account for population control very well. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/edexcel_pre_2011/environment/populationsandpyramidsrev5.shtml

My theory is that most animals have some level of average lifespan based on injury and predation, and evolution of health beyond that point stopped being an evolutionary driving point, and cells focus more on things like efficient metabolism to survive periods of starvation, and other more immediate threats. Some animals do seem to be immortal and continually make offspring. Other animals might get there eventually, but evolution hasn't gotten there yet. Remember that we had an evolutionary bottleneck 65M years ago, and mammals evolved from small subset of prey animals. The immortal animals tend to be sea animals who may have never had a similar pressure as land animals had. Our best bet is to study the differences at a cellular level of these long lived animals and see what the fundamental differences are, that will tell us if we have some limit programmed in (less likely because gene knock down experiments have not found any magic switches like that, even when trying several at a time), or that we are lacking or turning off important youth pathways in old age. 

These are all theories, and it's pretty stupid that we don't know more yet. We need to study aging a lot more, all of these are testable theories.

Summary from the paper:

The accumulation of irreparable cellular damage restricts healthspan after acute stress or natural aging. Senescent cells are thought to impair tissue function, and their genetic clearance can delay features of aging. Identifying how senescent cells avoid apoptosis allows for the prospective design of anti-senescence compounds to address whether homeostasis can also be restored. Here, we identify FOXO4 as a pivot in senescent cell viability. We designed a FOXO4 peptide that perturbs the FOXO4 interaction with p53. In senescent cells, this selectively causes p53 nuclear exclusion and cell-intrinsic apoptosis. Under conditions where it was well tolerated in vivo, this FOXO4 peptide neutralized doxorubicin-induced chemotoxicity. Moreover, it restored fitness, fur density, and renal function in both fast aging XpdTTD/TTD and naturally aged mice. Thus, therapeutic targeting of senescent cells is feasible under conditions where loss of health has already occurred, and in doing so tissue homeostasis can effectively be restored.",21,1490297070,longevity

&gt; Contrary to D2O, water with the reduced deuterium content (deuterium depleted water,

&gt; Radioprotective effects of DDW were studied by W. Bild [23], V.S. Turusov [24] and D.V.

&gt; patients who only were treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy [27].

&gt; P.A. Herzen and N.N. Blokhin with Institute of Biomedical Problems [28, 29], confirmed the
&gt; inhibitory effects of deuterium depleted water on the process of growth of various tumors,
&gt; i.g. division of breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 tumor cells being placed in deuterium depleted water
&gt; started with a delay of 5–10 hours. In 60% of mice with immunosuppressed immunity and
&gt; transplanted human breast tumor MDA and MCF-7 consumption of deuterium depleted water
&gt; caused tumor regression. A group of mice with transplanted human prostate tumor PC-3
&gt; consumed deuterium depleted water showed the increase in the survival rate by 40%; the ratio
&gt; number of dividing cells in tumors of dead animals in experimental group was 1.5:3.0, and in
&gt; control group – 3.6:1.0 [30]. In this regard special attention deserves two indicators: the delay of
&gt; metastasis and loss of animal’s weight during experiments. Stimulating action of deuterium
&gt; depleted water on the immune system of animals has led to delay of development of metastasis by
&gt; 40% in comparison with the control group, and weight loss in animals that consumed deuterium
&gt; depleted water at the end of the experiment was 2 times less. It was also reported that deuterium
&gt; depleted water may delay the progression of prostate cancer [31] and inhibit human lung 
&gt; European Reviews of Chemical Research, 2015, Vol.(3), Is. 135

&gt; carcinoma cell growth by apoptosis [32] – the programmed cell death, resulting in fragmentation
&gt; of the cell into separate apoptotic bodies bounded by the plasma membrane.
&gt; Preliminary experimental results on motility of human sperm [33], indicated that in DDW
&gt; (4 ppm) spermatozoa longer retain their functional activity, and it increases with a decrease in the
&gt; deuterium content of water, whereas the sperm motility is by 40% higher for 5 hours after
&gt; registration. However, the effect depends on initial properties of a sperm sample. These data
&gt; indicated that deuterium content variation in water including deep deuterium depletion produces
&gt; various non-linear isotopic **effects on key processes in the cell: enzyme action of Na, K-ATPase,
&gt; regeneration, motility, fertilizing effectiveness and embryo developing**. It should be noted that for
&gt; any deuterium concentration dependence there should be an optimal condition for the best result.
&gt; One prominent effect of deuterium depletion is the inhibition of fatty acids as well as the
&gt; synthesis, chain elongation and desaturation. These anabolic reactions utilize acetyl-CoA, as well as
&gt; hydrogen of water for new fatty acid biosynthesis [34]. Fatty acids then are used for new membrane
&gt; formation in the rapidly proliferating cell. The complex structure and molecular organization of the
&gt; mammalian fatty acid synthase (EC 2.3.1) offer remarkable opportunities with altered morphology
&gt; and flux handling properties.

&gt; The positive influence of drinking deuterium depleted water on blood chemistry **included
&gt; a significant reduction of glucose, cholesterol, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, leukocyte counts
&gt; and cortisol (stress hormone) levels, while also revealed an increase in antioxidant capacities** [35–
&gt; 37]. These data evidence the significance of deuterium depleted water to increase energy resources
&gt; even in a healthy cohort, while decreasing risks of psycho-emotional stress, which is known to pose
&gt; a negative influence on blood biochemistries that often lead to psychosomatic diseases and shorten
&gt; life. It was also noted the positive impact of water on indicators of saturation the liver tissue
&gt; by oxygen: the observed increase in pO2 was 15%, i.e., cell respiration increased 1,3 times [38].
&gt; On beneficial effect on health of experimental mice evidenced the increased resistance and weight
&gt; increase compared with the control group.

&gt; The main impact of DDW on organism is explained by a gradual reduction of deuterium content
&gt; in physiological fluids due to the reactions of isotopic (H–D) exchange: D2O + H2O = 2HDO. It was
&gt; recorded the change in the isotopic composition of urine and Ca2+ content as well. Thus, the regular
&gt; consumption of DDW provides a natural way to reduce the deuterium content in the human body to a
&gt; value of 110 ppm.

&gt; Clinical trials of DDW with a residual content of deuterium 60–100 ppm, showed [39] that it
&gt; can be recommended as an adjunct in the **treatment of patients having metabolic syndrome
&gt; (hypertension, obesity, impaired glucose metabolism) and diabetes**. In addition DDW improves the
&gt; quality of life for patients having renal stone disease (nephrolithiasis) and various disorders in the
&gt; gastrointestinal tract (colitis and gastritis), cleanses the body of toxins, enhances the action of
&gt; drugs and promotes weight correction. DDW can be recommended for fast and deep cleaning of the
&gt; human body from deuterium that is essential for metabolic disturbances. Taking into consideration
&gt; the dynamics of the distribution of water in the human body, the reaction of isotopic (H/D and
&gt; 16O/18O) exchange and the results obtained with DDW, it can be expected that the greatest effect
&gt; the isotopic purification of water will have on the regulatory system and metabolism.

&gt; The total effects of DDW depend on total body mass, total mass of intracellular water, the
&gt; amount of daily consumption of DDW and the degree of its isotope purification [40]. The results on
&gt; the calculation of gradual increasing of deuterium content in the human body at regular
&gt; consumption of DDW with varied residual deuterium content are shown in Table 5. These results
&gt; demonstrate that the content of deuterium in the human body decreases while consuming DDW.
&gt; Thus, at the consumption of water with a residual deuterium content of 60 ppm deuterium content
&gt; in the body decreases after 45 days to 117,3 ppm, and at the consumption of water with a residual
&gt; content of deuterium 100 ppm – to 131 ppm at 1 liter of water consumption per a day, to 122,6 ppm
&gt; at water consumption of 1,5 liters of water a day. Hence, the regular taking of DDW provides a
&gt; natural way to reduce the content of HDO in the human body to a value of 117 ppm.

That view is outright wrong, but an easy mistake to make, if you're not used to thinking in terms of dynamic strategic actors. Think about it at a fundamental level. Food is ATP plus some raw materials we use in our cellular structure, which we get by ingesting animal and vegetable tissues. Animal and vegetable tissue are ultimately generated from solar power, CO2, H2O and trace minerals. All three exist in abundance, both on the planet and in the greater solar system. Plants have terrible conversion efficiencies, but some great catalysts in chlorophyll that alleviate the terrible capture efficiency somewhat. A human engineered design can do better in terms of achieving certain goal. Even if we stick with plants, the amount of food we could grow using hydroponics is many orders of magnitude larger than current output. Price is an issue at the moment, yes, but with the trillions of dollars saved in health care costs for the elderly I'm sure sufficient R&amp;D could be done and sufficient infrastructure could be built to bring the costs down via more efficient processes and returns to scale.

TLDR: 

UW study compared fat monkeys to calorie restricted monkeys.

NIA study compared normal body weight monkeys to calorie restricted monkeys.

UW study showed reduction in mortality, while NIA showed minimal reduction in mortality in diabetes and cancer, and actually showed increase in cardiovascular risk. 

Assuming the reader is looking for lessons on how to live longer, I'm assuming you're probably already taking care of your health and probably aren't obese, and probably don't have diabetes or smoke. Your cancer risk is low comparatively to the rest of the population if you get your regular checkups. On the other hand, heart failure is going to be something that's going to get you later in your life. I'd say, the jury is still out on how this applies to humans. Basically, if you're fat, restrict calories per the UW results. If you are not fat, then don't restrict calories, but take really good care of your heart, per the NIA results.

However as age increases, so does the rate of the decline, and for most individuals, both number and function drop off a cliff in the late 60's and early 70's.

Changing this view is beyond the realm of the possible at least in the foreseeable future.

As long as they are overly concerned with what is ""natural"" this will be the case.

Life extension and health will be driven mainly by private ventures in the decades to come. ""Life extension will only be for the rich"" is a self fulfilling prophecy. The public doesn't want it, because the public believes it will not get it - and even worse - that they do not deserve it, in turn forcing the private sector to be the driver of innovation in healthcare, making any innovation in healthcare beyond the scope of socialized healthcare.

They're not ""magical"" devices that will tell you or can even approximate when you might kick the bucket. If you live in a western country, make a decent living, live a healthy lifestyle with some exercise, do not smoke and eat properly, you can, in all likelihood, expect to live into old age. If genetics are in your favor, that's a bonus.

However, this statement as well as any calculations made by these ""calculators"" do not account for any of the treatments that you would find discussed on this subreddit. There's simply no way to tell, at this point, whether or not any real treatments will be available and what age group will benefit from them. 

We're roughly the same age, personally, I firmly believe that our chances of seeing some form of treatment in our lifetimes is very good, though that's obviously more of a hope than anything else, as there is presently little data to support such a notion. Given the nature of anti-aging research, tangible evidence - even for working treatments - will take a long time to provide.

If you have poor mental health and a lot of stress, practice mindfulness before taking nootropics. Start at the bottom of the health pyramid and work your way up. 3) the mind likes equilibrium.

* I reduced my intake of red meat by around 95% since march 2016
* I try to get fish and nuts on a regular basis.
* Stopped drinking alcohol altogether more than three months ago.
* I sold my car so I'm doing most things by feet, but that's not enough: I will start daily cardio in january. Also considering weight lifting.
* Started dropping body weight, already lost 10kg. Will be in ideal BMI range in 2-3 months.
* I will have my genome sequenced sometime in early 2017 (maybe by Veritas Genetics)
* Frequent health checkups (prostrate cancer, etc.)
* Looking into health monitoring equipment (wrist bands, etc.), but have none yet

Better to study the mechanism of how it works more deeply, then create a very targeted approach - ie. what precisely is it about ""young"" blood that gives the effect, and how does that process happen?  

Understanding the mechanism of the effect will eventually yield a treatment that wont need young blood donors. The logistics are also much better if you don't need to manage donors - its far more scalable.

You'd could beat the other companies taking the young-blood-transfusion approach, and avoid the terrible optics.

Thats a misrepresentation - removing damaged dna, beta-amyloid, cancerous cells etc. is not equivalent to giving you a facelift, which is only skin deep.

yes, the cure is in the details - my point is we are uncovering those details much much faster now, because the advances of technology and basic science help each other, so its accelerating.  My other point is that we already have fundamental advances such as turning cells back into stem cells, which are only just beginning to be used in medicine.

I gather, based on your strawman comments, that you really don't like the guy - ""...no surprise for someone with his background""

It should be no surprise to anyone that biologists, even if they are in awe of the beauty and majesty of nature, view biology as amenable to the scientific method - yes, many biologists even think of the cell as machinery.  He would be preaching to the choir on that .. but if his audience is the general public, that might be something he would want to communicate explicitly [as its the general worldview of nearly all biological scientists ]

Are you proposing that we use some other approach to discovery that the scientific method - which is inherently reductionistic to some extent.

This approach to biology is not ""bound to get you into trouble"" .. its bound to yield results and allow you to discover how living things work.

Also, he is very explicit in stating that is is an incredibly complex system, possibly chaotic - he often talks of the ""un-commented spaghetti code that evolution has given us"" [sic]

ok, so it seems your main objection is ""Aubrey deGray has published no worthy scientific papers in cell biology, so he should shut up"" ... 

Even if he hasn't published important work in biology, his work in communicating and running SENS, I would argue is very valuable in itself.  

Perhaps don't be quite so dismissive of people from other scientific backgrounds working in biology - after all it was all those post-war physicists who helped biology advance in leaps and bounds [ protein crystal structure anyone, imaging methods/protein folding ... ] now its pretty obvious we need machine learning and nanotech and massive quantitative simulations along with the traditional lab techniques.

[ side issue - do we really understand everything about computers?  I don't think we have a _full_ description of quantum mechanics yet, certainly we don't understand everything there is to know about algorithms/cryptography/undecidability/distributed systems/AI ?  Still, we can use the great amount we do know, and apply that for useful progress ]

Even if advances come more slowly - say 50 years, not 15 - it is still clear that aged health will be dramatically better - 130 will be the new 80, 80 will be the new 50, just as 45 is the new 30 today.   We might as well talk about that because it will be the reality.

Preface, I'm biased coming from the perspective of a USA citizen.
It's already known that the middle class is shrinking over time while more wealth is being consolidated at the top and that the most common jobs are all easily automated.  There is also considerable resistance to the socialization of healthcare due to the power and control the pharma/insurance companies have.  Programs like social security and medicare are on a course to go bankrupt while tuitions for colleges are increasing over time.  Playing out this scenario without drastic correction I believe could easily lead to the dystopian future I described where the middle class disappears leaving a vast population of poor/debt encumbered people with little chance of gaining sustainable wealth while all being subscribed to some rejuvination therapy on the false hope that things someday get better which is advertised to them through front companies controlled by big pharma selling them their subscriptions.  You can already see the beginnings of this life extension supplement industry and it's a natural extension of big-pharma's approach to maintenance therapies to chronic illness.  Who would pay to retrain all these people to have jobs in a post-automation world?  Would they even want to or be able to learn a new vocation (especially later in life)?  Who would keep big-pharma in check to prevent these sorts of practices (especially if it falls under the supplement industry which can skirt around the FDA) when people believe that anything that promotes health is a good thing?

A drastic course correction is not likely to happen easily in any way; most people want things to keep going the way they are comfortable with and fear significant change because it means facing the possibility of things being worse of them down the road.  This goes especially for those currently with power/wealth.

,AlwaysUnite,"Hi there, this comment is overdue but severely needed, my apologies for the delay my stat mech exams interrupted my happy redditing. This post replies more in depth than my previous one which admittedly was too short to reply fully to the others.

##The Mediterranean diet

In response to the third message “It’s the Mayo Clinic, bud, the Mayo Clinic” regarding the health aspects of the traditional Mediterraean diet being a plant based diet, we can look at [the link](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801) provided and see that this it is clearly not a plant based diet. According to the presented pyramid therein, assuming that it is accurate, we see that the Mediterranean traditional diet consists of 4 parts animal products and 6 parts plant products. To designate this as “plant based” is like saying the United States is a liberal nation. It completely disregards basically half the thing.  Actual plant based diets such as vegetarian, vegan and traditional Okinawan diets consist of upwards of 90% plants. Incidentally all of this does support the original point I was trying to voice, namely that the more plants people eat, the healthier they get. Since the Mediterranean diet contains more plants than the Standard American Diet, and it has an equivalent (and probably slightly better) healthcare system, the expected result would be high life expectancies. It just doesn't go far not enough to get *more* than Andorran level life expectancies.


##""Acclimatized phenotypes"", Inuit &amp; Maasaai
The main argument mentioned against the plant based position involves the claim that two major metabolic phenotypes exist due to acclimatization to hot and cold climates, neatly summarized as ""monkeys don't eat salmon and Inuits don't eat bananas"". Despite the 'catchiness' of that phrase, it turns out to be wrong. Orang-utans for example do eat fish. They are known to furnish spears and [hunt for all kinds of fish]( https://primatology.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/orangutan-tool-use-fishing.jpg) in the Borneo rainforests (what is left of them anyway). And while the Inuit may not traditionally eat bananas this does not mean that they wouldn't if they could. And that if they did it wouldn't mean a measurable improvement of their health. Banana's just happen to be very expensive to bring all the way to some remote village by motor sled. So getting such an addition to the diet is just difficult not necessarily useless or genetically harmful. The idea that Inuit are fine regardless of their intake of animal products is [seriously questionable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12535749). The same goes for [the Maasaai.](http://nutritionstudies.org/masai-and-inuit-high-protein-diets-a-closer-look/)

Furthermore if the acclimatization hypothesis purported by hastasiempre is correct we can cure all cardiovascular disease, diet related cancers, Alzheimer's disease and a great number more, simply by changing the thermostat. 

In addition to these two points the story presented in the three posts above is inconsistent. The Chinese traditional diet is included in the “heat acclimated phenotype” which is especially odd since [Beijing regularly looks like this]( http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2015/07/30/st_20150730_sptoly_1556681.jpg?itok=PYTPkMka). China does contain some extreme regions like Hainan Island and the disputed islands in the South China Sea which are tropical but the region where the vast majority of the population lives is as temperate as Northern Europe. The climate of the northern part of the Yellow River valley is comparable with the climates of southern parts of Sweden, Poland and Lithuania, albeit with higher concentrations of rainfall in the summer. And Southern China mostly has a temperate climate equal to the climate of Serbia or the Russian Black Sea shores.

Finally, and this is why I referenced to Dawkins earlier, even if a careful rational evaluation of the available were to indicate differences in cholesterol and animal protein adaptation this would not occur due to acclimatization but due to evolutionary change in the genome. Acclimatization is not a way to get major changes in the body such as the ones in question here. This is because acclimatization, as far as it is long term and goes beyond mere direct physiological reactions like shivering, relies on changes in gene expression (activation). You can't express genes for eating additional cholesterol from ones diet if those genes do not exist. Consequently the evolutionary history of an organism is vastly more important than the acclimatization of it to its surroundings during its life time (this is one of the cornerstones of Darwinism and one of the main reasons why Lamarckism was eventually discarded).

Though I do go into a bit more detail below the general gist of this essay can be summarized by [this source](http://nutritionstudies.org/masai-and-inuit-high-protein-diets-a-closer-look/) which also provides ample references to the medical literature.

## 5 out of 7 figure

&gt;you are right that the prevalent traditional diets are plant-based, maybe around 5 out of the 7 Bil people eat diets which are mainly carbs

While it is nice to hear someone say “you are right”, in this case I’d rather you didn’t because the 5 out of 7 figure you are giving is, as far as I can tell, not true. The figure (which I have been unable to find in any literature so far, which adds to my doubts about it) I must assume refers to plant vs animal based diets. In populations where over the course of evolutionary history (the last 2 million years in very broad terms, the last 100,000 years in general terms after the migration out of Africa and the last 10,000 years in particular since the invention of agriculture and animal husbandry) animal products have outweighed plant based ones adaptation to meat eating for example could have occurred. Based on the current pastoralist population of the planet however, [see this rough estimate]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H5Hlh2OGkIM9-6bOjcScbGrRno0_8ur1IQTOeGW1wfk/edit?usp=sharing) I made, pastoral societies form approximately 2% of the world’s population. And this tally includes groups such as the Fula of western Africa of which only a third is pastoral, therefore likely overestimating the total pastoral population. In this small pastoral population it may very well be that genetic mutations have occurred that would allow its members to consume any level of animal based products without negative consequences. The Maasaai could be such a group, although the Inuit are not. However, more importantly most of the world's population does not belong to this category. Consequently there is no way to get a animal product adapted phenotype in the human species based on our evolutionary history (genetic engineering would be a whole different case of course, but so far people balk at such practices because they consider them unethical).

This estimate is probably to high even as most of the pastoral population does not belong to the adaptation capable group and the Maasaai are probably more exception than rule here. For example the [Fula]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11722953) and the [Inuit]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12535749) are not capable of regulating the LDL and HDL cholesterol levels to optimum ranges regardless of intake as the Maasaai are. Because of this they either suffer similar levels of cardiovascular dissease (Inuit) or have to resort to energy intake restriction and high levels of activity (Maasaai). The fact that some pastoralists do not have this adaptation is explained by [this general reference]( https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Popular-Science/dp/0192860925), the fact that pastoralist societies are often cut of from one another by agricultural societies, and finally the fact that mutations such as those didn’t tend to spread through agricultural societies because they exact energy costs on populations that don’t use them. This of course does mean that Maasaai genes do have an evolutionary advantage in modern day North America but there is clearly not enough genetic transfer nor generational overturn for the mutation to spread through the North American population at this time. A little later on in the longer post the Tuoli people are also mentioned as having a similar condition as the Maasaai, literally [the first hit]( https://rawfoodsos.com/2010/06/23/tuoli-chinas-mysterious-milk-drinkers/) on google however states that the evidence on them should be taken with “a whoppin’ huge grain of salt” and that it should not be used for quoting to the benefit of meat nor citing it as evidence, because the Tuoli were feasting the day the researchers of the China Study came. Thus they seemed to consume a lot of meat yet they had the health of plant eaters (which they really were the rest of the year).

##Conclusion

&gt;there is NO single HEALTHY diet

Yes there is, a plant based one, that is at least 90% or ideally more, of energy intake from a wide variety of non-toxic plants, while ensuring either via micro intake of animal products or supplements that B12 and Omega-3 intake stays sufficient. Ample evidence in favour of this assertion has been posted in this thread for anyone to verify this statement, but also [here]( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1520-037X.2001.00538.x/full), [here]( http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/25/1/202.full), [here]( http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/544S.short) and [here](http://tinyurl.com/gw888h2).

&gt;Why support the SENS Research Foundation, and their ally the Methuselah Foundation? Because these organizations have proven capable of using your charitable donations more effectively than any other in order to make significant progress towards an end to aging and age-related disease. For fifteen years now, the principals and their network of advocates and scientists have nudged, debated, and funded researchers to ensure that the broader research community builds the basis for human rejuvenation. Aging is an accumulation of molecular damage, and if that damage is repaired sufficiently well, a goal that modern medicine is only just starting to grapple with despite decades of evidence, then the result will be a halt to the processes of degenerative aging. An end to the disease, dysfunction, and suffering of aging. When you look at near any area where the academic laboratories or biotechnology companies are making good progress towards this end, you'll find the SENS Research Foundation and Methuselah Foundation in the background and the history of that development.
&gt;
&gt;The current brace of senescent cell clearance startup companies, working to bring this treatment to the clinic, after it has been shown to improve health and longevity in mice? SENS Research Foundation funding has for years helped that research progress at the Campisi lab, one of the groups that joined forces to create UNITY Biotechnology, recently funded for $116 million. SENS Research Foundation and Methuselah Foundation provided seed funding for Oisin Biotechnology, where the principals are building a better approach to senescent cell clearance than that fielded by UNITY Biotechnology. Or how about work on allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes, a way to prevent mitochondrial damage from contributing to aging by placing copies of mitochondrial genes in the cell nucleus? The SENS Research Foundation and Methuselah Foundation before it helped to fund the research programs that led to Gensight Biologics, a company now deploying tens of millions of dollars to build a platform to back up mitochondrial genes. Or how about progress towards treatments capable of clearing out the glucosepane cross-links that produce tissue stiffening, such as the loss of elasticity in blood vessels that produces hypertension and tissue damage? The SENS Research Foundation has funded the few interested researchers for years, enabling them to build the toolkit needed to work with glucosepane, and now researchers are at the stage of hunting for the first drug candidate.
&gt;
&gt;I could go on: the advocacy and conferences bringing together academia and industry to build a new development community; the support for thymic rejuvenation and other means of immune system repair; the work on a universal cancer treatment based on blockade of telomere lengthening; the mining of bacterial enzymes to find those capable of removing damaging metabolic waste products that our biology cannot handle. The point is that the SENS Research Foundation and Methuselah Foundation deliver. They take our donations and use them to make a real difference, creating step by step progress towards the therapies that will enable us to live far longer in good health, and effectively treat and prevent age-related disease. If the damage that causes aging can be periodically repaired, even poorly at first, then ultimately aging will be brought under control. As the therapies become better and more comprehensive, no-one will need to suffer.

&gt;Food in Daily Life. The diet in Andorra is based on consumption of meat, garden vegetables, and some fish. The most common winter dish, in rural and urban zones, is escudella, a soup of veal, chicken, potatoes, and vegetables. Some immigrant communities have different customs: Portuguese eat more cod and Indians, more vegetarian food. Normally, the midday meal is eaten near the workplace in a restaurant.
Many Catholic families still avoid eating meat on Fridays. At the feast of the Virgin of Meritxell, Andorran families often eat outdoors after the solemn midday mass: they consume cold cuts, chicken, and rabbit. The Christmas cycle is also an occasion for the organization of family meals.

Meat, in the form of lamb, game, pork, fish and poultry, is an important part of the local diet, and is usually served with pastas, sauces, potatoes and *some* vegetables. Among Andorra’s specialties are trinxat -bacon cooked with potatoes and cabbage; escudella - a chicken stew with sausages and meatballs; tender dandelion salad; formatge de tupi -cheese fermented with garlic and brandy; and cunillo - rabbit cooked in a tomato sauce.""

What I'm suggesting is that, in order to *maximize* those gains, you might have to greatly restrict activities you gain a fair deal of enjoyment from and adopt the greater cognitive burden of frequency exercising will power to restrain from detrimental behaviors. 

For instance, say we were to eat restrictively healthy diets. I have, at times, found myself on the road for work along with a group of coworkers. When we get hungry, the preference is to stop for quick and easy food rather than nutritious healthy food. In many cases, I've found myself feeling stressed having to decide whether I'm going to partake and not alienate myself from my coworkers with my stricter dietary preferences, or hope that I'll have an opportunity to find healthy food later at a reasonable price that will be energizing enough for me to perform sufficiently at work and maintain my mood. If that weren't enough, I am then further exhausted restraining myself from the visual and olfactory cues compelling me to give-in if I want to join my coworkers inside the fast-food joint (e.g.) while they eat. 

Now, one meal isn't going to make or break a lifespan. But if *maximizing* is your goal, it *does* entail a certain obsessiveness. It is, by definition, not maximizing if you're not maximizing consistently and in every regard. Moreover, as someone who has been on the road for long stretches of time, it gets exhausting trying to eat well and exercise adequately, and I'm on the road long enough for these choices to meaningfully impact my health and weight. 

Now, as you said, if it's causing loads of chronic stress, it's not good for longevity. But it's impossible to know where the threshold is: the point at which the increased stress outweighs the benefits of restricted behavior. 

The only workable approach seems to be to try to follow only the most general advice rigorously (have a good diet, don't smoke or drink to excess, and exercise regularly), use supplements as necessary, and otherwise focus on enjoying life and being socially and intellectually engaged. 

Worrying about whether you might be able to add another year or two onto your life in order to marginally increase the probability of existing when an intervention for aging hits the market - and doing everything in your power to ensure it - seems excessive and, yes, potentially obsessive. 

**TL;DR**: 

&gt; I took you as implying that we should do everything in our power to *maximize* potential gains in lifespan and not chance missing out on even a relatively insignificant gain of a couple months of increased longevity.

,bucketlist_guy,The other thing is that I don't really care about 5 more years of life.  I want my last 20 years or so to be in relatively good health and not in chronic pain.,2,1475887226,longevity
,A0220R,"For some, though, that's a significant cost (financial and otherwise) for a small probability that the extra months they *might* add will be essential for access to a 'cure' - or at the very least, some technological/medicinal advance that allows for marginal life extension. Positive emotions modulate the immune system, and, for some, regulating their life so restrictively could alienate them from social support (correlated with longevity), reduce the frequency of experiences of positive emotions, or even cause undue stress (raising cortisol and leading to inflammatory responses throughout the body). 

It's just not wise to only focus on biological processes. Many of the longest lived individuals have smoked, drank, and been relatively inactive. That's not to say that those factors contributed to their longevity - their longevity is likely predominately due to genetics - but their longevity seems most correlated not with health-related decisions but rather large social and familial support networks, a largely positive and relaxed attitude about lifestyle, and a conscious decision to engage primarily with activities, diets, and life choices that they most enjoy, rather than those which would be most longevity-promoting. 

Despite longevity being a preoccupation of countless individuals throughout history, there seems to be no clear cases where any individual who prioritized longevity has ever accomplished the sort of lifespans that most centenarians enjoy. And that's despite the fact that, probabilistically, there must have been individuals with longevity promoting genes that obsessed about longevity sufficiently to try to do all they could to promote it. 

Not to mention, there are myriad other risks that you can't account for at all that could make it all for naught. In 50 years, your nation could look like Syria. Or maybe you'll just be unlucky enough to be involved in a fatal car accident. 

Right now, aside from the obvious lifestyle choices (regular moderate exercise, healthy dietary choices), it seems we'd be best served taking a more relaxed attitude towards lifestyle choices and focus instead on social engagement and finding purpose in work. ",2,1475872884,longevity

,LifeRulz,"I honestly think 115 is pushing it in terms of ""natural lifespan"" as many of those people alive are very old and decrepit and hanging by a thread. So yes this article is correct in saying natural life span is around 115-120 but by the time you get there by today's standards, you will feel like a walking corpse if you walk at all.

Personally from what I have studies yes there are people in their late 90s and early 100s that are living independently and in general good health but still have medical conditions that are chronic even as simple as arthritic pain or loss of cartilage effecting mobility barring any other major illness. Plus just the appearance of looking old is not very appealing. Anything after age 80 or pushing 85 if a personal really takes care of themselves even with the very few exceptions that look great for their age is all rapidly downhill.

I think the goal is at least in the short term 15 to 20 or so years should be to make 100 the new 60 like peter diamandis is aiming for meaning when a person is a 100 they will look feel, and act like a healthy fit 60 year old today.

,mister_longevity,"Hi,
I have been reading about health related items for years but just have recently added focus on longevity.
Vegan. New convert, was Paleo but I have been unable to find a long-lived group that ate high protein and fat. 
Low protein consumption, IDK &lt;10%
Low BMI, maybe 6-8% bodyfat but good musculature. Near zero abdominal bodyfat.
I am thinking there is huge synergy re: nutritional density and longevity in the Okinawan diet. The purple sweet potato and the seaweed I think play perhaps the largest part. In 1919 an Okinawan   farmer ate around 90% (!) of his 3650 calories as carbs, most of which were sweet potatoes.  There is magic in the purple anthocyanin. And they made do on only 4.3% protein.
Near zero sugar consumption. 
There was a mouse study showing that if the mice were fed exclusively a super low GI diet they increased longevity as well as CR.
I eat steamed then cooled then re-heat as necessary potatoes and rice to lower the GI by locking in the resistant starch.
I sauna (not IR) hoping that the heat shock protein HSP70 which seems to increase longevity is activated. I think it was a Finnish study that showed lower mortality among those that sauna with the greatest benefit to those that did 4 times a week for 19 minutes. No further benefit after that.
I intermittent fast by eating in a roughly 8 hour window as much as practical.
Water only fast for 72 consecutive hours most months.
Total Vitamin D avoidance, including sunlight on my bare skin. I am outdoors a fair bit but never uncovered.
WiFi avoidance, just wired the house with ethernet.  Also don't put my cellphone to my head, use speakerphone. Sleep with it in another room.
Brief 10 minute workout a few times a week with 4 basic exercises done at a high intensity, as heavy as possible, not quite to exhaustion. Clean and press, dips, trap bar deadlifts on a 5 inch platform so I can go lower, chinup/pullup. 2 sets each 10-15 reps, 2 exercises on a day with at least a day off.

I mean yes there are people in their 80s and 90s in good shape but they still look old and in general not as active and resilient to diseases compared to people under 70. I mean if you really take good care of yourself people who are in their 70s can feel and look great for their age I mean look at chuck norris at 76.

In the short term my hope is that we can make 100 the new 60 within 25 years meaning that at 100 one can look and feel as young as they would be as a 60 year old in good shape today. That would mean one can look and feel young until around 70-80 an slowly age from there and by the time more anti aging treatments would be available.

It's not invalid to consider the typical experience of the majority of the population and in that sense we have made huge leaps based on the technologies mentioned, and continue to make gains in other areas to enable more people to reach their maximum potential lifespan.   

The gains we've made in pushing back the limits of the maximum possible lifespan are harder to define. The established maximum possible lifespan in humans is 122 years - in the case of Jeanne Calment. But she died in 1997, and no-one has bettered that since. Given my family background, health, sex etc I would be looking, on current projections, to make 85+. I could do better or worse (I’d hope to do better as I have a number of relatives in their 90s now). But that’s roughly 20-25 years less than Jeanne Calment. What was it about her that allowed her to live so long and in such good health? She took up fencing in her 80s, lived relatively independently into her 100s, yet smoked for much of her life and modern best practice on maintaining health into old age wouldn’t have reached her. 

Much of the current focus of outfits like Calico and HLI is on trying to identify what exactly it is about the extreme long-lived that enables them to do it, and in many cases enjoy fairly good physical and mental health until near the end. Many seem to simply avoid the big killers of cancer, heart disease, stroke, AD until very late on.

3 years ago I developed extreme inflammation in both legs. Not real surprising as I's shattered both legs skydiving 27-years ago and it was age catching up with me, you could say it was in the cards.

For 6-months all the sodium naproxen, hours of leg elevation and ice packs I could muster and nothing, not to mention all the PT sessions. 

I'd been following the research since 2004 but it was only available in lab qualities costing thousands. In 2013 that changed.

So in January of 2014 I started taking (NR), took it for a month, all the while with my wife laughing at me wasting my money but it gave me the energy to get back on my feet and the swelling went down. Still my wife persisted and I stopped after my supply ran out. (incidentally I wasn't taking the recommended dose, if I remember correctly 500mg per day)

Then the swelling returned after 2 weeks.

I gave it another week and knew I'd felt better before on (NR). It felt like I'd fallen into a sudden fog. The funny thing is what I didn't realize I'd been pulled out of a fog and felt myself falling back into it.

Strange how slowly day-by-day you can have your awareness whittle away and not take notice because it becomes the norm. Then one day you wake up and know you lost part of yourself and you feel like its slipping away again but this time you have enough awareness to remember how sharp you were in the days before and want clarity back.

I bought another bottle and haven't stopped since. I also tried a number of things to complement the (NR) but if they didn't bring noticeable change they were discontinued. I also picked up honokiol which is a traditional chinese “folk” medicine. This should be googled because there are so many papers coming out on this stuff lately. Its a SIRT 3 activator among other things. Google honokiol BPH. Kind of a surprise because I was looking to increase the anti-inflammatory properties of (NR) and found after my BPH medicine ran out I could void without my pharmacy prescription drug. This was only the beginning and with time other things began to change.

The age spots I was developing have faded. My focus at work has increased my work performance and concentration have noticeably increased not to mention my reading which has skyrocketed.

I'd developed some neuropathy in my feet which after my accident wasn't surprising and today I'm almost back to normal but it didn't happen overnight.

I can have my cup of coffee in the morning but I'm not really awake until I start my (NR) regiment which is 8 125 mg capsules over 12 hours per day.

Seems the younger guys don't notice anything so dramatic if at all. Seems you have a maximum NAD threshold. So even mega dosing with NAD precursors will only raise levels so high. At some point we have feedback loops that stop the NAD production. Younger people are already closer to that NAD set point. 

What's been found is as we age, we get a rise in an enzyme called CD38. It eats NAD+ and the older we get the more we produce. Its a condition closely tied to cellular senescence. There are some experiments with mice that have been genetically altered to make senescence cells susceptible to a drug that wipes them out. Remarkably NAD levels rise and inflammation decreases. It makes these mice appear younger which they are not. Consequently for the rest of us NAD+ falls as the CD38 increases in a direct relationship and inflammation follows.

As it turns out raising NAD repletion can directly effect cellular metabolism and repair and also slow or reverse cellular senescence giving old cells a little more productive time. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127236

I'm one of the LongeCity advocates for NAD repletion. I don't think this is the final answer its just a hack. I think the CD38 conundrum must be solved and there is some hope on the horizon.

Until then I see us like a boat with a slowly growing leak and we are bailing water with a coffee cup trying to keep afloat but at some point we can't bail fast enough. So I feel the NAD precursor approach is just a stop gap measure until we fully understand and correct the CD38 conundrum. Oh and in a twist we need CD38 so we can't just inhibit it all together.

&gt;The advent of tools capable of accurately assessing the state of biological aging, such as measurement of changes in DNA methylation patterns, means that researchers can now produce additional and more robust data on quite small differences in longevity that exist when comparing various human populations. Measurement doesn't say much about why these differences exist: there we are back to discussing the degree to which it is genetics versus lifestyle and culture. Nonetheless, this particular study provides good evidence for the utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker of aging, given that the results match up fairly well with those obtained from statistical population data. Having a reasonably accurate measure of biological age is very important for the future development of rejuvenation therapies, as it will make it much faster and cheaper to determine what works and what doesn't work. The cost of research and development will be greatly reduced if researchers can immediately test the results of a potential rejuvenation therapy rather than having to wait and see what it does to health and life span.

""Beverly Hills MD"" - Ew.  This is a flytrap for scared rich people.  They posted their BBB rating on their front page.  Nobody who is credible does that.  For comparison, [Cutco Knives](https://www.cutco.com/home.jsp#sm.00019ayb9zc9bfc2wrf1pkgbj1o61) posts their BBB A+ rating and they are a known scam.  So already it smells like we're starting off with a scam here, but lets take a look at what they say.

""Because, as I’ve said before, your body converts nearly everything you eat into sugar — even fruits, vegetables, carbohydrates"" - carbohydrates are sugar.  This is biology 101.  They're aiming at a target market that knows nothing about biology.  Furthermore, your body converts protein/carbs/oil back and forth depending on your needs using the tricarboxylic cycle.

This looks like a standard keto meal.  Then there's the justification.  Some pretty basic stuff included here:

- Aspirin is well known as something which helps with aging, but typically I've seen it associated with prevention of heart failure.
- Vitamin C is required for natural antioxidant regeneration.  It's a basic requirement of being human if you don't want scurvy.
- Antioxidants - right now the general consensus is that the ones you eat do nothing for you.
- Benfotiamine - never heard of it, hasn't really come up in the stuff that I've read.  Can't comment on this.

- Carnosine - this one was interesting, because eating meat is typically associated with a reduction in lifespan.  The referenced paper was behind a paywall, but it's available on researchgate for free.  This sentence holds a lot of weight:

""Suji and Sivakami (2004) discuss how diet might influence glycation and cite the observations of KrajcovicovaKudlackova et al. (2002) who found that levels of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) in the plasma of vegetarians were higher than those detected in omnivours. As an explanation Krajcovicova-Kudlackova et al. (2002) suggested that the higher intake of fructose by the vegetarians induces the raised AGE plasma levels.""

And the conclusion section of the review is below:

""It is clear that much research is required to determine whether carnivorous diets or carnosine-supplementation do in fact suppress protein glycation and the secondary
complications of diabetes. Similarly it is unknown whether carnosine and related dipeptides (e.g. homocarnosine) exerts any protection action with respect to Alzheimer’s disease or other neurodegenerative conditions where glycoxidative
events are involved. The present discussion has outlined a case for more research in this area, but because carnosine and homocarnosine cannot be patented one wonders whether the likely absence of any large financial profit from such studies would hinder investigation. Conversely, however, should such studies reveal that carnosine, homocarnosine or carnivorous diets do benefit to human health, their relatively
low costs might be considered to be more socially desirable than expensive patented pharmaceuticals.""

,reasonattlm,"https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/an-effort-to-obtain-more-human-data-on-plasma-transfusion-from-young-to-old/

&gt;Here I'll link to a recent press article on Ambrosia, a company currently working to obtain more human data on the effects of transfusing young blood plasma into old individuals. The aim is to see whether or not this can usefully change the balance of signaling molecules to, say, spur greater stem cell activity. There has been a trial in Alzheimer's patients, but some signs in animal studies that transfusions from young to old don't do much. It seems useful to speed up the process of determining whether or not transfusions are an interesting line of research, or something that only looked promising. That means more patients and larger trial populations, which Ambrosia is working on.
&gt;
&gt;These transfusion initiatives are one of a number of outgrowths of parabiosis research in mice. Heterochronic parabiosis is the name given to connecting the circulatory systems of an old and a young individual. The older mouse shows a modest rejuvenation in a number of measures of aging, and the younger mouse shows some greater signs of aging - though most of the focus here has been on the old mouse. In recent years this technique has been used to search for potentially actionable differences in levels of specific signal molecules circulating in the bloodstream. For example, stem cell activity declines with aging, and this is likely governed by signaling processes. If levels of the most relevant molecules could be adjusted in old individuals, it might be possible to produce benefits that look quite similar to those of stem cell therapies: increased regeneration and tissue maintenance. This class of approach puts damaged, aged cells back to work, and does little to address causes of aging based on accumulation of metabolic waste, such as cross-links that stiffen blood vessels, but to the degree that it can improve health it is probably worthy of further investigation in the same way as stem cell therapy was back in the day.
&gt;
&gt;One potential shortcut to the production of therapies is to perform transfusions: deliver young blood or young plasma to old individuals. I call this a potential shortcut because it really is still very uncertain as to (a) whether or not the whole process works in humans anywhere near as well as it works in mice, and (b) whether or not transfusions will recapture the effects of parabiosis to a useful degree. The evidence in mice suggests so far that it may not. It is possible to paint all sorts of scenarios in which the fact that old and young cells are in contact, feeding signals to one another in a feedback loop, is necessary to produce beneficial changes in the old individual. It is also possible to imagine signals with a short half-life, that won't be recaptured in transfusions, or changes in the old environment that are based on an increased level of specific signal molecules. That increased level won't be changed in the slightest by the arrival of some amount of young blood plasma. Only reduced levels are likely to be impacted that way.
&gt;
&gt; In any case, testing and perhaps ruling out the fast path of transfusions seems like a fair plan. If it works, it will draw in more funding to build the better option of manipulating signal molecule levels directly. It if doesn't work, that result will direct scientists to focus on more productive lines of research and development. There is some grumbling from the expected quarters over the structuring of this present initiative by Ambrosia, but getting it done is better than not getting it done. The data will be useful in the sense that only sizable effects are interesting, and thus before and after data for participants will be convincing. Marginal effects, of the sort in which it would have been useful to have a control group to establish whether or not any benefits actually resulted, would mean that this probably isn't worth further exploration. Still, this well demonstrates the fact that many scientists who work within the heavily regulated, slow, and repressive system of medical development really don't like it when people try to get things done more rapidly and more inventively. To the extent that it closes down productive avenues, this is a dangerous attitude.",2,1470271434,longevity
,plumbbunny,"To get a proper answer, you’d need to get more specific. When you say “work very little,” do you mean sedentary, or do you mean a person who works little for others but remains active? If they work little for others, their stress levels could be lower and that could be beneficial, but only if they are active. If they are sedentary, it’s not beneficial for longevity.

As for napping, the bigger question is what is the longest stretch the person sleeps at one time? For instance, people who sleep less (up to a point), live longer than people who sleep for periods of 8-12 hours. Part of that correlation might be underlying health conditions, as might a person who takes many naps. Though it is also speculated that sleeping long periods might be detrimental due to the sedentary nature of it.

* https://www.cnio.es/ing/publicaciones/mice-with-hyper-long-telomeres-without-altering-the-genes

&gt;Researchers investigating telomeres, telomerase, and aging are now trying to isolate effects of telomere length from effects of telomerase by employing a novel method of breeding mice with very long telomeres. Telomeres are repeated DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes that form a part of the limiting mechanism for cell division. Telomere length falls with each cell division, cells self-destruct or become senescent when telomere length is short, and stem cells employ telomerase to lengthen their telomeres to retain their ability to generate new daughter cells with long telomeres. Average telomere length in tissues then derives from some combination of cell division rates and cell replacement rates, and tends to fall over the course of aging. Work on lengthening telomeres in mice over the past decade has focused on the use of telomerase, such as via gene therapy. This has been shown to extend life and improve health, an outcome likely to derive from increased stem cell activity.
&gt;
&gt;But is the telomere length or is it the telomerase? Telomerase lengthens telomeres, yes, but that isn't its only activity. Like all proteins, it plays a role in many mechanisms, not all of which are fully mapped at this point. A sizable fraction of the research community see reduction in average telomere length as an outcome of the state of age and damage - a marker of aging, and not a cause of aging. In this context, finding a way to extend telomere length without the use of telomerase is a good choice for further exploration of the mechanisms, and that is the achievement made by the research team in this case. The results of this study, demonstrating a slowing of some measures of aging purely based on longer telomeres, present a challenge to the view of telomere length as a marker only, though we can still argue over whether it is a primary or secondary mechanism of aging, especially when measured in immune cells. Possible mechanisms of enhanced health that could derive from telomere length only might include lower levels of cellular senescence, for example, and it would be interesting to see that measured.
&gt;
&gt;Researchers have succeeded in creating mice in the laboratory with hyper-long telomeres and with reduced molecular ageing, avoiding the use of what to date has been the standard method: genetic manipulation. This new technique based on epigenetic changes avoids the manipulation of genes in order to delay molecular ageing. In 2009 researchers described that the in vitro culture of induced pluripotent stem cells caused the progressive lengthening of telomeres, to the point of generating what the authors called ""hyper-long telomeres"". Sometime later, in 2011, it was found that this phenomenon also occurs spontaneously in embryonic stem cells when cultured in vitro. The in vitro expansion of the embryonic stem cells results in the elongation of the telomeres up to twice their normal length, and without alterations in the telomerase gene. However, would these cells be capable of developing into a mouse with telomeres that are much longer than normal and that would age more slowly? Researchers now prove that this is the case.
&gt;
&gt;The cells with hyper-long telomeres in these mice appear to be perfectly functional. When the tissues were analysed at various moments (0, 1, 6 and 12 months of life), these cells maintained the additional length scale (they shortened over time but at a normal rhythm), accumulated less DNA damage and had a greater capacity to repair any damage. In addition, the animals presented a lower tumour incidence than normal mice. These results show that pluripotent stem cells that carry hyper-long telomeres can give rise to organisms with telomeres that remain young at the molecular level for longer. According to the authors, this ""proof of concept means that it is possible to generate adult tissue with longer telomeres in the absence of genetic modifications"". The next step that the researchers are already working on will be to ""generate a new species of mice in which the telomeres of all the cells are twice as long as those in normal mice. Then, we will be able to address some of the important questions that remain unanswered: would a mouse species with telomeres that are double in length live longer? Is this the mechanism that is used by nature to determine different longevities in genetically similar species? Would this new species present a higher or lower incidence of cancer?""",7,1470075681,longevity

What I really wanted to do was to get in great physical shape doing body weight exercises and deep breathing which I now do for hours every day and yeah I'm in really good shape.  I quickly learned that for a person who spends six to eight hours exercising per day the key is to avoid injuries. 

So, for instance, I do pull-ups and bar dips all the time but I found that I was developing wrist problems and major callouses on my hands so I learned to avoid grips that led to wrist problems and started wearing gloves. Then I started doing extensive floor exercises and again the wrist issue was big. I found I had to use my knuckles instead of my wrists and now I have callouses on my knuckles but I could easily punch a hole in a brick wall. Wanna fight?  

Just kidding of course. Life is good.

AFAIK, the evidence doesn't support multi-vitamin use.

http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253

&gt;Despite sobering evidence of no benefit or possible harm, use of multivitamin supplements increased among U.S. adults from 30% between 1988 to 1994 to 39% between 2003 to 2006, while overall use of dietary supplements increased from 42% to 53%... The large body of accumulated evidence has important public health and clinical implications. Evidence is sufficient to advise against routine supplementation, and we should translate null and negative findings into action. The message is simple: Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death, their use is not justified, and they should be avoided. This message is especially true for the general population with no clear evidence of micronutrient deficiencies, who represent most supplement users in the United States and in other countries",5,1468673890,longevity

&gt; A new study by patient safety researchers shows common medical errors may be the third leading cause of death in the U.S., after heart disease and cancer.

&gt; Their analysis, published in the BMJ on Tuesday, shows that &amp;quot;Medical errors&amp;quot; in hospitals and other health-care facilities are incredibly common and may now be the third-leading cause of death in the United States - claiming 251,000 lives every year, more than respiratory disease, accidents, stroke and Alzheimer&amp;#039;s.

&gt; Kenneth Sands, who directs health-care quality at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, said that the surprising thing about medical errors is the limited change that has taken place since the IOM report came out.

Aubrey once got a question to that effect and answered that we don't know, so #1 isn't as much of an argument against him as you think. The good part about SENS is that it doesn't really matter which it is -- if you clear the damage you get young, regardless of the circumstances that made it accumulate. SENS also works if the ""programmed aging"" school of thought is true. In terms of its treatment plan it's agnostic as to exactly how and why the damage got there.

If the body does have the capacity to completely repair itself it needn't be case that anything in particular ""prevents"" it from doing so. Maybe it just isn't efficient enough, not doing it at a fast enough rate. Humans can run, but we can't outrun tigers.

People like de Grey have gotten quite a bit of publicity in the recent years, but if you read a typical article you'd see, when the experts are asked for opinions about what he's saying they will always be skeptical at best and in the worst cases they'll be outright rude - I remember a nice article from last year with some professor or another telling de Grey, they should work on flying pigs now that aging is resolved.

Unfortunately, medicine is very much a dogmatic science. 
The best way to advocate for anti aging research is to popularize disruptive medical research to the wider medical community. But that can only be done efficiently by the medical professionals themselves.

Perhaps these centenarians are just better at handling high amounts of calcium, but the book also referenced a 2004 World Health Organization paper that found that populations with hard water had 25% fewer deaths from heart disease, since calcium is essential for muscle contraction (The Blue Zones; pg. 202). I suppose the results could be due to other minerals in the water that outweigh the ill effects of calcium, but nevertheless I thought you should be aware of this.

* It doesn't really matter if we call it a disease, a set of diseases, or something else. We want to be able to control / slow down / reverse it. The Holy Grail, the Fountain of Youth, Philosopher's Stone... For thousands of years we have been obsessed with solving this problem. 

* chronological age is how old you are. ""biological age"" is a metric we'll need in order to show that age reversal therapies are effective... In other words you have given your therapy to some mice, and not to control mice, how do you show that the exp mice ""got younger"" (lifespan is a measure of longevity, but aging is more complex than just how long you live. Also, that's  a VERY long clinical trial when it goes to humans).

* so people have used many metrics to measure ""biological age"" (telomere length, methylation, NAD levels, etc.) but there's not a clear cut, agreed upon way to do this. 

* there is also some debate as to whether aging has a root cause (like a master regulator set of genes) or if it is many different processes that happen somewhat independently, this is important to know if we want to modify the process with a therapeutic. 

* there will be small molecule (drug) and genetic (gene therapy) strategies to reverse or delay symptoms of aging. These have different considerations in terms of one-time treatment vs. Continuous treatment, who can benefit from it, etc. 

* it is technically possible to engineer the engineer the human germ line (modified humans will reproduce, pass on modified genes), this raises ethical, legal, social questions that are by no means settled yet.

* One degree safer (more likely to be approved) would be modifying genes of adults but not their germ cells (modified genes aren't passed on). This would be a gene therapy, not many are approved today, but thousands are in clinical trials. 

* On the other hand, once a small molecule aging drug gets approval, that is a more simple process 

* if a master regulator is responsible for the decline in many areas of health associated with aging, then maybe there will be a holy grail drug that reverses the whole process. More likely, in my opinion, is that we will solve each symptom or set of symptoms (muscle mass, wrinkles, bone strength, many more...) separately ",5,1466936657,longevity

This hints at a paranoid mindset. Mental illness is not a binary on or off thing where people have it or they don't. Rather than being a black and white thing, it's a spectrum and a key metric on that spectrum is paranoia. 

Rather than focusing on some ill-defined enemy maybe it's worth assuming that the vast majority of people would love to have long lives for themselves and the people they love. Perhaps it's just institutional intertia and people's tendencies to repeat well-practiced habits which makes change seem so difficult rather than some shadowy organization of nefarious villains who want people to die.

To break it down into an even simpler explanation: watch a compost pile to see which parts break down the most rapidly.

[Laughs] When Americans reach for protein, they tend to reach for animal products, which also contain fat and several toxic ingredients. People who are eating the highest levels of meat in this country have about 70 percent higher mortality than people who are eating little meat and a four-or five-times-worse chance of developing cancer. A cup a day of beans for protein is much cheaper and you’re not getting all the harmful ingredients with it. The big secret Blue Zones offer us is ways to make beans taste good. We don’t put any of our culinary effort into it. If you go any great restaurant, it’s going to be a steak or something wonderful done with pork. In Blue Zones, culinary effort is put into making things like an Ikarian stew, which is done with black eyed peas, fennel and garlic, and finished with wonderful virgin olive oil.

He made his doctor promise that if he made all these Blue Zone changes, he could go off the five medicines he was taking for the kidney disease. His doctor said, “OK, but I’m checking you in six months and if your kidney disease persists, you’re going back on those medications.” Bob came back in six months and his kidney disease was gone. He then got all the city employees on board. Over the course of just one year, he saw the healthcare cost for city employees drop by 25 percent, which he attributes to the Blue Zone. So here you have this wonderful example of a city getting healthier but also—and this is where the rubber hits the road—saving money.

The United States is a tough nut to crack, given the preponderance of fast foods outlets and wall-to-wall TV adverts for pizza. What are the biggest challenges?

First and foremost, our food environment. We can’t walk out of the house without being confronted with chips and sodas and fast food restaurants. We are evolutionarily hard wired to seek fat, sugar and salt. For most of human history this was a good thing. It enabled us to survive through hardship. But now we live in an environment of abundance and ease. The onus to stay healthy is mostly put on individual responsibility. It’s up to you to make the right choices instead of the bad choices. Well, forget that! [Laughs] You cannot make the right choices when your genes are screaming at you all day long to consume these things and we live in an environment that is shoving them in our faces. We have to shift the focus away from individual responsibility to changing our food environment: to minimizing junk food marketing and shifting the economic incentives to produce junk food, towards making healthier choices not only easier, but unavoidable. It sounds like a pipe dream. But it can be done.

What lessons of Blue Zone living can our readers bring home?

First of all, we have Blue Zone food guidelines, which offer a clear prescription for what we ought to be eating if we’re interested in living to 100. Number two: we ought to take a hard look at our social networks. If your friends are sitting on the couch eating Doritos, there’s about a 150 percent chance that you will be, too. Number three is to get really clear about your purpose in life. According to Gallop, fewer than a third of Americans are doing what they love at work. So, if you’re not living out your purpose at work, you’d better be doing it at home or in your extracurricular or volunteer activities. I’ll add a fourth one - and this is a disruptive. Think about where you’re living.

Statistically speaking, where you live is the biggest, non-genetic influence on how healthy you are. If you’re living out in a suburb around a forest of junk food places, you’re not going to escape un-healthiness. You can live in a place like Binghamton, where about 37 per cent of the people are obese and they have very lax food policies. Or you can go to a place like San Luis Obispo, where there is 11 percent obesity and their leaders said a long time ago: we’re going to bring in policies that help our people eat better. Lo and behold, decades later, they’ve achieved it. We’re working with 23 cities that have enacted food policies. Every city has the capacity to do this.

You must have had some wonderful times going around the world to these different Blue Zones. What was the high five moment?

Exploration is more than about someone going to a place and making observations, which will sell magazines or books. Where exploration really earns its keep is when it improves the human experience, or adds to the body of knowledge to make our lives better. The first American city where we took observations from the Blue Zones and applied them was Albert Lee, Minnesota. In so doing, we raised life expectancy by three years and brought health care costs down by 40 percent. That was the big high five moment.",4,1464038817,longevity

In 2012, Dan Buettner set off around the world to answer a question that has obsessed philosophers and doctors since Methuselah: Why do people in some parts of the world live so much longer than others? His travels took him to Greece, Nicaragua and Japan, among others. Then he brought the lessons back to Main Street, USA.

Speaking from his home in Minneapolis, the author of The Blue Zones Solution: The Revolutionary Plan To Eat And Live Your Way To Lifelong Health explains why the inhabitants of the Greek island of Ikaria are some of the healthiest people on the planet; why where you live and the company you keep, determine your longevity; and why we should all be having more sex.

Obvious question: What is a Blue Zone?

It’s a term for our project, first and foremost, but it’s been loosely used to describe parts of the world where people live the longest. More specifically, areas where we have a demographically confirmed, geographically defined, area where people are either reaching age 100 at extraordinary rates, have the highest life expectancy, or the lowest rate of middle age mortality.

Diet does tend to be the entrance ramp for better health.

In 2012 Dan Buettner spoke with National Geographic Magazine Editor-at-Large Cathy Newman about longevity and reaching 100.
Tell us about Ikaria, in Greece, “the island where people forgot to die.”

It’s in the central Aegean, just off the coast of Turkey, very close to Samos, where Pythagoras and Epicurus lived. This is an area that was largely isolated from the rest of ancient Greece and even modern Greece, and it incubated a set of lifestyles and a population that lives about eight years longer than average, with just a fraction of the [average] rate of dementia. So, these people live a long time. More to the point, they’re sharp to the very end. Whereas here in America about 50 percent of people over 85 are suffering from dementia.

Diet is a key ingredient. What are they eating on Ikaria that’s so good for them?

Diet does tend to be the entrance ramp for better health. In Ikaria, they are eating a variant of the Mediterranean diet. But they’re unique in that they eat a lot of potatoes. Their bean consumption is also high. Perhaps the most interesting ingredients are greens they call horta, which look like the kind of weeds the Department of Transportation would whack on the side of the road. They employ them as salad greens or greens that they’ll lightly steam and bake into pies. These greens are the food that’s most highly associated with healthy aging.

According to the Ikaria model, we should be having lots of sex, drinking wine and napping a lot. The Greeks are onto something, aren’t they?

That’s not a hard sell, is it? (Laughs) But it’s actually true. If you’re napping 30 minutes a day, five days a week, your chance of heart disease is about one third lower than if you muscle through the afternoon. We know that people who are having sex after the age of 50, at least twice per week, have about half the rate of mortality than people who aren’t gettin’ it. We know that moderate drinkers actually outlive non-drinkers. Wine has high levels of polyphenols and antioxidants. The alcohol in the wine also helps lower cortisol levels, a hormone associated with stress. If you drink a glass of wine with an Ikarian meal, it about triples the flavonoid absorption. It’s actually better to have a glass of wine with your meal than a glass of water. But not with your steak. That doesn’t work.

We are evolutionarily hard wired to seek fat, sugar and salt.
We are obsessed with fitness. But in Ikaria, exercise seems to play a negligible role in longevity. Should I cancel my gym membership?

None of the spry 90 and 100 year-olds I met exercise in the way we think of it, like spending half an hour on a treadmill. The secret they teach us is the importance of engineering “nudges” for physical activity into our daily life, like planting a garden, which sets up a nudge for the entire growing season to be out there watering, weeding or harvesting. And don’t look to completely convenience your life with mechanized tools. Houses in Ikaria have just hand tools. They knead bread by hand. They live in a place where every trip to the store or to work occasions a walk. I know it sounds hard to do in our lives. But you can make the decision to move your family from the suburbs to the city, for instance, where that kind of unconscious physical activity can re-enter your life.

Another “laboratory” you studied was Okinawa, in Japan. What are the key ingredients to a long life there?

The general trends are the same. They eat a plant-based diet; they live in walkable communities; their life is imbued with purpose. But the diet is obviously very different. They have the highest per capita consumption of tofu in the world, but eat very little fish. Sweet potatoes and turmeric are also two interesting longevity foods. About 60 percent of the dietary intake of Okinawans used to be sweet potatoes, which are high in flavonoids and complex carbohydrates. Turmeric has been associated with lower rates of cancer, and healthier hearts. It’s the yellow spice we use in curries. I’m not a big fan of supplements, but I’m a fan of turmeric.

The Okinawans also have something important called “moai”. It’s not a food, is it?

If you’re lonely in this country, it takes about eight years off your life expectancy as compared with the most connected people. In Okinawa, they traditionally don’t have to worry about loneliness because when you’re a child, you’re put by your parents into these moais. It can be defined as a committed social network that lasts a long time: a personal board of directors. I profiled several 102-year-old women who had belonged to the same moai for 98 years. They still gossip and drink sake and argue. But ultimately have each other’s backs when it comes to tough times.

If being alone is disturbing you then perhaps you should actively seek companionship but if you're just worried that there are correlations between being alone and various long-term health effects you're probably thinking too much because there is a high potential that those correlations are related to other factors. For instance, people who are depressed are often not fun to be around and would likely find themselves alone at a higher rate than a healthier population and that depression could lead to further problems like poor self care. 

It's quite possible to be happy and healthy and all alone. I wonder if it's possible to be quite so carefree when others are around. In my life anyway, I look forward to time alone like a child looks forward to candy. I find it hard to get any space precisely because I'm a very nurturing person and that's attractive to others when you cook and clean for them and care about their needs but it can make it very hard to find time alone when you live that way precisely because people become dependent upon you.

,reasonattlm,"https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2014/05/a-world-of-inadvertently-held-stoic-views/

&gt; One of the aspects of ancient Stoic philosophy is that length of life and even present health is of little concern when it comes to happiness.  There is far more to stoicism than this small slice relating to happiness and length of life. It certainly isn't the ""philosophy of what I'd do anyway,"" but this small slice does more or less reflect the default view of the public at large. Most people strive for happiness in the moment and ignore their future longevity, which one might argue is some mix of (a) following the example set by the norms of past behavior, (b) a response to lack of certainty and control over the future value of money and other forms of wealth, and (c) that all-too-short human time preference again. But so what if we have a world of people who hold stoic views with respect to longevity and years of health remaining, but without any real intent of doing so. Why does this matter? It matters because defeating aging and age-related disease is a grand goal in medicine. Even if the prototype technologies might be pushed to the point of demonstration in mice for a billion dollars and ten to twenty years of work, well within the purchasing power of a large multinational research company or collaboration of billionaire philanthropists, vast resources and many hands will be needed to translate that into a full, mature, worldwide clinical industry. At this sort of scale at least a sizable minority of the population must support the goal in question for it to have a hope of moving from possibility to reality. The near future of human longevity is not just a matter of research and building the tools needed to repair the damage of aging, but it is also, vitally, a process of convincing enough people that this is even worth doing. Anyone who has spent time looking at exactly what it means to be old, at the drawn out pain and suffering inherent in the age-related failure of all organs and bodily systems, might be forgiven for thinking that we live in a madhouse. But nonetheless, most people simply don't care about research, medicinal science, progress in clinical applications of medicine, or the future of their health, or how long they will live. These things are not important to them, and won't be until such time as they are in the clinical system asking how their pain and lost function can be assuaged - which is far too late.",2,1462469642,longevity

Also, I avoid the sun, but admit that I look much healthier with a tan. It's almost a trade-off I feel between looking good now and paying for it later or not looking as good but living longer. I'm more concerned about my vanity to be honest, but I also want to be the healthiest I can be. 

I try to strike a balance. For me, that means instead of aspiring to Schwarzenegger size, I'll adjust my expectations and be smaller yet shredded. I fast once or twice a month instead of weekly or more. I try to get more of my protein from vegetarian sources.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Cumulative sun exposure causes mainly basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer, while episodes of severe blistering sunburns, usually before age 18, can cause melanoma later in life.^2

If we take this as true that would mean that the vast majority of skin cancers are caused by cumulative sun exposure however the vast majority of deaths are caused by long periods in the sun such as those that cause sunburn. So in a sense we are both right in that while sun damage is cumulative, in regard to life expectancy the effect of cumulative sun exposure is very small being responsible for only 2,000 deaths per year in the US. In my own life I do take measures to reduce sun exposure and use sun screen daily and would still recommend it if only for the secondary benefit of decreased skin aging.

I saw this when I became fascinated by buildings made with alternative building techniques. The new techniques were always criticized for things which the existing alternatives also suffered to an even greater extent. I was quite fond of building walls of newspapers ground up and mixed with cement combined with cans and people would say --""but the newspapers could burn!"" but in fact they couldn't burn because they were mixed with cement. The paper could smolder but it couldn't sustain a flame. Meanwhile, people were building houses left and right of timber which easily supported deadly flames.

Recently, there has been a heightened awareness and research on the subject of life extension and it is now recognized by many researchers that there are, indeed, many ways to extend life beyond the 100 year mark.

In my opinion, most people die far earlier than they should due precisely to their lack of preparedness. 

There are no guarantees, but it does not hurt if you were to assume you were, indeed, going to live a long life, say to 140, and started to live the rest of your life as if this were absolutely true, meaning that you would have to take better care of your body so you could last all that time in such a good state of health that you would be able to enjoy every day of your life until the day you actually pass away.

Death, I am sure, happens rather quickly and most people don't even realize they are actually dying. Unless, of course, you fall sick with one of those diseases that take several years to actually kill you and you have to suffer all the pain of the disease and the treatments.

Thirdly, get your blood and hormone levels checked; you never know what kind of problems might be lurking around the corner.

If you find a problem there, you can work on preventing any kind of permanent endocrine damage before it happens.

I would guess it would be very possible if your body felt starved, stress hormones (cortisol) ran very high under a low carb scenario, but under a high carb (quality carbs like lightly cooked sweet potato, greens) you were satiated.  

When you drink coffee, epinephrine raises blood glucose, but it's not normally as much as your levels.

I'm not saying this is what is going on with your body, because I frankly have no idea.  I don't know if you have hypertension or what your other issues are.  It's also important to note that I'm not a doctor, but I sit on the board of a healthcare non-profit and have enough of an academic medical background that I am somewhat conversant in a few areas.  My main area of research interest is lipidology, hence I'd be interested in your trigs and cholesterol profile.

You really need to get a qualified viewpoint from an endocrinologist and make sure that when you are looking at issues like blood glucose, you are not only looking at them in a fasting scenario.  You need to look at how your body is responding to a meal.  Google glucose tolerance test and look at how the time/response looks over a 2-4 hr period.  I would start to play with your meals by testing and seeing what the reaction is.

,Deeviant,"Aging is caused by entropy. 

Aging is *not* a single a process. It's a cumulative collection of ailments that occur over ones whole life.

A non-exhaustive list of things that cause aging:
 
* Gamma rays bombard your body constantly and degrade/mutate DNA.
* Free radicals oxidize/destroy/damage various cells. 
* Unabsorb-able minerals and/or waste products accumulate all over the body. 
* Viruses attack your very DNA, and subvert it to their purposes. Often creating reservoirs  throughout the body. 
* Small DNA encoding errors  occur in cell replication. Telomere's get slight shorter every replication, when they get too short, the cell line is dead.
* The longer one lives, the higher the chances one will be subjected to some sort of health hazard. Be it physical trauma, toxic chemicals, harmful radiation.
* Many other things that I either am not aware of or forgotten.

All of the above things are part of the aging process. In a sense the statement that ""aging does not exist"" is somewhat true, there is no one single thing that you can point at and say, ""This is aging."" Unfortunately, this makes it harder to address, as to truly fight aging, we are going to have address a very large group of issues. But that's fine, I think we can and we will. Entropy is completely reversible in a open system.

Responding to your points:

&gt; First, plants don't appear to age.

Plants do indeed age. They have a completely different metabolic system and have very different body structure, so they *can* age a lot slower than us, but it doesn't take a genius to look at an old tree vs a new tree and see very very similar mechanisms working on the old tree as those on old humans.

&gt; Then there is parabiosis. 

The young gets older and the older gets younger. What I can't see is how you take this for evidence to your point. At this point, it seems to me that you stated with a conclusion and attempted to fit the facts to your conclusion. I can't see how any reasonable person would look at those two points and conclude that ""aging does not exist"". When you join the mouse, your basically just averaging them out, and we get exactly that result, this works in humans too. 

Explanation of what's happening with the mice:


Old mouse: The blood from the young mouse contains all kinds of beneficial cells, that have not been subject to as much entropy as the old mouse blood cells have, they are more vigorous and effective at healing and protecting the body, nothing particularly hard to understand about this. The old mouse gains benefit from having the more effective beneficial cells(Including stem cells) in their body.


Young mouse: We already know that young mouse has more effective beneficial cells in it than the old mouse to start with, but then you take some of those away and replace them with less effective beneficial cells and potentially exposing it to various pathogens (which an older mouse is more likely to have), this is not going to make it more healthy.

I am skeptical of explanatory processes like autophagy. We have beautiful theories to explain why antioxidant should make us live longer... sadly we know that they make us live shorter... 

&gt; Also, just wanted to point out that your ""healthy weight/low protein vs fasting/CR question"" brings up a few inter-related issues. As long as a person maintained a reasonable weight ( low blood pressure and good insulin response etc.) and restricted protein then yea, I suppose the incentive to fast or CR is minimized.


The benefit might actually be zero. Or they could even be negative compared to someone who is health conscious.

*The latest results from a 25-year study of diet and aging in monkeys shows a significant reduction in mortality and in age-associated diseases among those with calorie-restricted diets. The study, begun at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1989, is one of two ongoing, long-term U.S. efforts to examine the effects of a reduced-calorie diet on nonhuman primates.*

-------------

*Weindruch also points to some results from the NIA that seem to contradict the ""no significant result"" analysis. Twenty monkeys entered the NIA study as mature adults, 10 in the test group and 10 in the control group, and five of these (four test monkeys and one control monkey) lived at least 40 years. ""Heretofore, there was never a monkey that we are aware of that was reported to live beyond 40 years,"" Weindruch says. ""Hence, the conclusion that caloric restriction is ineffective in their study does not make sense to me and my colleagues.""*


And the pubmed article is nothing more than conjecture. 


The simple truth is we have no way of knowing how proper caloric restriction would play out in a wide range of humans over a 50+ year timespan.  Even if maximum lifespan is not extended, overall health, vitality, and wellbeing is a critical component to the equation.

Failing to meet the minimal requirement for NAD can result in pellagra.

There is no compelling evidence, however, that excess NAD is beneficial to humans. Some animal models report that Nicotinamide riboside (NR) can have what appear to be anti-aging effects. NR is available as an over the counter supplement.

As someone who has spent a fair bit of time researching sirtuins (the class of proteins thought to be responsible for mediating any benefits of NR), I cannot recommend it. There are too many molecular pathways which are likely to be sensitive to NAD levels (some in a good way, some in a bad way) that it is impossible to predict whether a person would receive a health benefit.

Liz Parrish has done another hour interview with Singularity host Nikola Danaylov.

Highlights:

1. It seems objectively clear, at 4 months after therapy, that Parrish has lost visceral fat and gained muscle mass. Obviously there are more mundane explanations than myostatin inhibition.

2. She estimated that the cost of therapy, should it prove successful, would be tens of thousands of dollars 5 to 7 years down the road. (Yeah, I know. Just remember how long the FDA would take to do this.) I guess this means it will be a while before I can eat more often than every other day :(

3. Hard data is going to take 12 to 18 months to accumulate. Her company intends to look at numerous markers with the help of third parties including Harvard. This is not a matter of simple blood tests. There are numerous tissue samples and MRI studies to examine as well.

4. There are no negative effects in her report. She shows no signs of ill health.
 
5. She said that in rodent studies, TERT therapy resulted in larger brain mass. It was unclear whether it delayed brain atrophy, or actually upregulated neurogenesis.
 
6. In a few different interviews, she has mentioned shorter sleep latency and higher sleep quality, saying in one case that she felt sleepy not long after sundown. This to me is more significant than the body composition measurements because, in the absence of pharmaceutical intervention, it would be difficult to engineer deliberately in the way that working out can improve body composition predictably. (Liz says she only takes vitamins.) Moreover, it's suggestive of neurological improvement, which is consistent with #5 and would frankly be remarkable, considering that her CNS was not directly infected. Unfortunately her neurological status will be very hard to quantify.

The reason I say this is because it decreases adipose tissue and increases fgf21 as well as foxo3. Just decreasing adipose tissue to the same amount that occurs in MR would likely increase lifespan multiple years in the majority of Americans. However I don't think that we should be spending research money on a CR mimic as the people who want to follow CR/MR can do it now and there may be side effects which most people won't accept such as lower energy levels and slower thinking. 
I think gene therapy is a better path than a CR mimic. FOXO3A gene therapy would make a significant difference in the possibility of someone making it to 100+. We know this from multiple studies on genes in centenarians. I don't think there is much disputing this. There are other gene variations which confer longevity with seeming little drawback. This type of longevity approach may be one of the paths that Calico is pursuing.

&gt;Out of a total cohort of around 2,000, a sub-group of 121 people were treated with bisphosphonates for an average of 3 years.

All were eligible for bisphosphonate treatment. Post-randomization, we followed patients for 3 years and ascertained bisphosphonate treatment, medication adherence and persistence, all-cause mortality, and new clinical fractures. Proportional hazards analyses with time-varying treatment status were undertaken.
RESULTS:
The final study cohort included 209 patients: 136 (65%) females, 104 (50%) older than 75 years, 90 (43%) with poor self-reported health, and 38 (18%) underweight.

Normally type 2 diabetes shortens lifespan by around 8 years but people who took metformin lived longer than non-diabetics.  You have to remember though that it is unknown if the benefits will occur in healthy individuals. One benefit that will likely transfer to non-diabetics is that it will likely delay the onset of diabetes in people who would have had or will eventually get type 2 diabetes. 

Metformin has been studied for decades and is generally seen as safe. Clearly nothing is without side effects but eating red meat is probably more dangerous than metformin when you read the various studies on both. The main side effects are diarrhea in medium to high dosages and B12 deficiency which has been found in 10-30% of the people who take it. I would feel comfortable with someone in my family taking a low dose metformin who was their 30s as long as they supplemented with B12.

It is much better to start preventing damage in your 30s than wait until your 65.

Methods and results from the study correlating excess sleep and death:

""In 1982, the Cancer Prevention Study II of the American Cancer Society asked participants about their sleep duration and frequency of insomnia. Cox proportional hazards survival models were computed to determine whether sleep duration or frequency of insomnia was associated with excess mortality up to 1988, controlling simultaneously for demographics, habits, health factors, and use of various medications.

Participants were more than 1.1 million men and women from 30 to 102 years of age. The best survival was found among those who slept 7 hours per night. Participants who reported sleeping 8 hours or more experienced significantly increased mortality hazard, as did those who slept 6 hours or less. The increased risk exceeded 15% for those reporting more than 8.5 hours sleep or less than3.5 or 4.5 hours. In contrast, reports of ""insomnia"" were not associated with excess mortality hazard. As previously described, prescription sleeping pill use was associated with significantly increased mortality after control for reported sleep durations and insomnia.

Patients can be reassured that short sleep and insomnia seem associated with little risk distinct from comorbidities. Slight risks associated with8 or more hours of sleep and sleeping pill use need further study. Causality is unproven.""

You keep saying ""your"" or ""you"" when you're in the same boat, which points to your mindset, as if you feel you're above and outside it all. IMO it shows how you've distanced yourself in order to feel like you have the big picture view, maybe in order to feel immortal yourself.

It is not. Most likely, we will upload into robotic bodies before we cure all diseases. It may not even possible to ever cure all diseases. Our bodies were simply not made to be immortal.

Delaying or reversing aging does not entails ""cure all diseases"" or making us immortal. It is mostly about rejuvenating bodily functions. 

You do not even need complete success... Nobody thinks that in 35 years, you will take a pill and look like you did when you were 20.

But it seems entirely likely that we will be able to restore muscle and bone function to within 20% of what they were at 30 and keep it there. There are hints that oxytocin is part of the answer. This could come quite soon... maybe in the next decade (2020s).

Restoring the immune functions is maybe more difficult, but immunotherapies are already used in practice with good success... It looks likely that in 30 years, we will be able to boost the immune functions in the elderly in ways that might mimic what the young have today. It might require constant interventions and close monitoring, so there will be a cost to it, but I think it will be effective. Because this already works, and there are trials in this direction (for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's), it seems likely that we will make good progress in the next 10 years.

We have no clue what to do about inflammaging right now, but it would be surprising if we did not have therapies in 30 years.

It also looks likely that progress in perigenetics will enable us to tune gene expression so that aging is likely slowed. This already works in animal models. Google is betting big bucks on this one through Calico. I do not think that they invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Calico with the expectation that nothing will come out of it in the next 30 years... So reasonable people think that we will make progress in the next, say, 20 years...


With these factors combined, you would greatly improve the health of the elderly... and some of it won't take 30 years.

Your point is that these therapies will have undesirable side-effects. Sure they will have them... 

So this will not make you ""young again"". You will still be ""old"" and not as good as you were when you were 20... You will be somewhat younger, but with odd problems that we cannot foresee today. Fine.

But, honestly, if you take the HIV analogy... people who do not want the side-effects, can just reject the medication and go on to die... I suspect that this option will still be open to people who prefer to die due to aging. 

The point is that HIV can be *managed* today. I think aging will be similarly managed in 30 or 40 years. Not perfect, but not something that kills you in short order.

That one line in the middle gets all the way down to a quite low level of health, and then stays down there for a long time, become coming back up.    For people in that group, they've got a shot at living for a very long time, but they will also have several decades where things get and stay quite dodgy and risky before coming back up.  

People in that group who survive will quite likely have a great deal of emergency medical treatment for different disorders, will experience rises and falls in several different types of health, and may need everything that medical science can do before we are able to actually restore people to full youth and health.  You may have to have some risky major surgery, like having organs replaced with 3-d bioprinted organs, or with mechanical organs, several times before medicare moves past that level.

&gt;__Roy Lee Walford, M. D.__ (June 29, 1924 [San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), US – April 27, 2004) was a pioneer in the field of [caloric restriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_restriction). He died at age 79 of respiratory failure as a complication of [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis) (commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s or motor neurone disease). He was a leading advocate of [calorie restriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction) as a method of life extension and health improvement.

,Sanpaku,"It would be wise to understand what cellular mechanisms the compounds effect, first.

Some high polyphenol foods with demonstrated health benefits in humans are toxic to dogs: chocolate, tea, citrus, grapes, mushrooms, onions and garlic, hops. Our ancestors adapted to neutralize and even use plants' phytochemical defenses, while wolves (though fairly omnivorous for carnivores) largely depended on prey herbivores to detoxify plants.

In general, I'd avoid compounds active through the Nrf2 and AhR pathways (including berberine and curcumin) as dogs likely have less robust means of detoxifying these compounds. C60, which likely acts as a mitochondrial membrane uncoupler, may be fine. Caloric or methionine restriction probably works, and I'm considering adding gelatin to homemade dog food as the high glycine content may act as a methionine restriction memetic.

 maybe some subreddits that i have added will end up adding too much noise to the general ""longevity direction"" and should be removed/replaced .  maybe you have objections or criticism regarding the scientific rigour of the content of certain subreddits: maybe a ""truehub"" alternative should be created by a motivated and knowledgeable redditor then added to the longevity multireddit.

  i think motivation and focus is important when it comes at one's longevity  so that's why i added some ""self-help"" type of subreddits.

I also want this subject to be more popular, accessible and down to earth, focusing on things that are doable right now so i added subreddits about mental and physical health, nutrition, positive sexuality and even personal finance and some humour.

i think it is important to keep the social aspect alive and central to the longevity project so i will look for subreddit that could be relevant at that level.


I would like to hear more personal stories, if some members would be so kind to share what they are doing on a daily basis: I think /r/GiveMe40Days  would be a great platform for this either for people who need to get to speed with what they know they should be doing  and people who are already having a good and stable  longevity everyday lifestyle and feel like sharing their experience: if you are interested about this you could start a thread over there and link to it on this subreddit.

,bashetie,"Very good points, it would be great if methionine explains a lot of the connections you made. 

The degree to which methionine restriction contributes to the benefits of CR is not settled as far as I know, though researchers have speculated that the specific components of the diet (rather than just the # of calories) are responsible for the benefit for quite a while. Initial reports of lifespan extension (in mice/rats) by methionine or tryptophan restriction were in the 80's and 90's. 

One reason to question the relative role of methionine restriction is that it doesn't extend life as robustly as CR. It's possible, however, that no one has found the optimal reduction of Met required to mimic CR.

Also, the benefits of CR aren't necessarily a result of altered IGF-1 signaling alone. CR also significantly affects mTOR signaling. It's very difficult to uncouple the role of IGF vs mTOR because they have many interacting components. A recent paper in Cell Reports showed that, in worms (c. elegans), inhibiting both pathways synergistically increases lifespan, suggesting that they are mechanistically distinct. In the ames dwarf mice (very low IGF-1), inhibition of mTOR (by Rapamycin, the drug you mentioned) showed additional benefit. In growth hormone receptor knockout mice, however, inhibiting mTOR had marginal effects and only in one gender... so it's really not settled. 

The methionine study you mentioned looks at IGF-1 levels, which likely play an important role, but it's over-simplification to equate these changes with the total health and lifespan improvements of CR. 
 
There are also transcriptome/proteome comparisons of CR vs Rapamycin or IGF interventions, which basically give a similarly mixed message. 

I believe it's been shown that methionine restriction is necessary to decrease oxidative stress during CR, so it might primarily account for that effect. (Again, this reduction alone can't be used as a proxy for an overall lifespan benefit, but it is likely involved)

That's not to say phytates don't have any deleterious effects, as it hasn't been fully tested, but they've been seen to actually help people maintain optimal calcium levels: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmg9kLe3tQI",4,1392427449,longevity
,Diddmund,"I got one thing to add to this debate:
Look up ""The China Study""

This is the largest nutritional/epidemiological study ever conducted, on measuring the incidence of different kinds of cancer, heart disease and similar ailments in various location in China.

What is truly interesting is that a certain type of e.g. cancer will be seen at a great concentration in a particular urban area while being almost unheard of in another urban and/or rural area.

The highest cancer and serious illness rates were usually linked with more recently ""westernized"" areas of China.

This links to the book. I don't claim that this test is the holy grail of nutrition science, but it's an indicator that the link between nutrition and health is very palpable.

,Warped6,"I believe its 3 cups a day minimum for the anti-cancer effects to be really notable. I should point out that, like a lot of longevity boosting things, you do trade some health issues for others, While Coffee may decrease your risk of a bunch of different cancers it also slightly increases your risk of heart disease because of the caffeine (and no, decaf did not have the same effects as straight black coffee)",1,1388174727,longevity
,Suaber,"NAD seems excellent.  It could be the second prong of a two pronged approach.  The main part of reversing aging will involve restoring damaged stem cell DNA to a youthful, undamaged state.  Without that, I'm afraid NAD will maintain health up closer to the end, but not extend lifespan much if at all, and possibly shorten average lifespan by wearing out the body faster, kind of like the scenario with the metabolically fast ""replicants"" in the movie Blade Runner.",3,1387978240,longevity

,ArthruDent,"There is an April 24, 2013 Chicago Tribune article titled [Can stem cells help those with arthritis?](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-24/health/sc-health-0424-arthritis-stem-cells-20130424_1_stem-cells-farshid-guilak-cartilage) that discusses the use of stem cells to treat osteoarthritis which states:

&gt;Several studies in animals show that stem cell injections may help by reducing the inflammation in the joint. Stem cells appear to have a natural capacity to produce anti-inflammatory molecules, and once injected in the joint, can slow down the degenerative process in osteoarthritis.

At the end of the article, however, there is the following warning from  Dr. Farshid Guilak, a professor of orthopedic surgery and director of orthopedic research at Duke University, who was one of the first researchers to grow cartilage from fat:

&gt;**Q: Is it legal to get stem cell treatment for osteoarthritis in the U.S.?**
&gt;
&gt;A: While there is great promise for stem cell therapies, there's little clinical evidence supporting it for arthritis; we don't yet know if this type of treatment is safe in humans, or for that matter, that it even works. Some physicians are offering these treatments without FDA approval, but I feel it is irresponsible and potentially dangerous to perform such a procedure without having a clear understanding of the possible risks and benefits. Several clinical trials are planned and ongoing, mostly outside the U.S.
