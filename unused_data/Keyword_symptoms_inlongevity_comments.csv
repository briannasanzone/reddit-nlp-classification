FDA forces RTB101 to use patient symptom report not hard bio endpoint of lab-confirmed infection so trial fails. Then FDA approves aducanumab based on hard bio endpoint of Aβ clearance despite lack of improvement in patient symptoms. Seems inconsistent.

There's disgruntlement w/ both decisions, but even w/o arguing against either individually it's easy to argue the inconsistency of symptoms vs underlying bio is problematic.

This is true for most people that live beyond 90, my personal thesis is that centenarians possibly have genes that help protect them against cancer, and then they get lucky in not getting heart disease and the like. But this cardiovascular isn't something ""different"", it's not a disease that can't be diagnosed, and in fact it's very consistent with the cumulative damage theory. After long enough, the cardiovascular system is simply damaged to the point where it can no longer function, and no available medicine is able to repair it. That explanation is very concise and in my view seems to reflect the facts. It's not really true that they don't have symptoms leading up to it; aging itself is the symptom. Most people in their 80's and older have breathing difficulties, muscle degeneration, cognitive decline, high blood pressure, i could go on.

8,redpills1,"""life extension treatment"" can be many things. Every life saving treatments can be called ""life extension treatment"". There several kinds of life extension treatments, one is focused on treating diseases and will probably only give us a modest rise in life expectancy.

There are life extension treatments that will focus on giving us small improvement in some downstream symptom of aging like senolytic drugs that kill senescent cells. Those treatments will probably won't give us more than a modest rise in life expectancy.

And there is a life extension treatment that is focused on complete rejuvenation and eliminating chronological age as a factor for our health and will make people pretty much immortal.

The one that is focused on complete rejuvenation will probably only be available for rich people or people who saved enough money for it. It will be expensive and many people(especially those who are poor or live in poor and undeveloped countries) won't be able to afford it. Some people want to believe that it will be free or cheap but it seems like over-optimism(and I am an optimist myself). Many people can't afford relatively simple life saving treatments.

18,clinicaltrialist,"I won't try to answer whether aging is a disease or not because different people mean different things when they say aging.

But I can tell you what a disease is. A disease is an artificial intellectual construct that we (mostly doctors but sometimes others) create so that we can have a handle for a set of symptoms and signs. There is no a priori definition of pneumonia or diabetes for example. Doctors came up with those definitions over time through pattern recognition, and now you have committees of academic physician arguing endless about whether the definition of diabetes should encompass blood sugar of 99 or 100.

As an analogy, disease boundaries are similar to boundaries of countries. Generally, they follow geographic boundaries like rivers, but they don't always, and they change over time.

There used to be disease classifications that are no longer used. Consumption. Melancholy. Hysteria. There are new disease classifications that didn't exist before. Depression. Restless leg syndrome. Don't get me wrong. The patients who have those symptoms and signs always existed. The way we slice and dice the symptom constellations have changed over time.

Why do those definitions change? Partly it's because we understand biology better so we can recategorize them, much as taxonomists use DNA data to re-arrange species.

But, most diseases are categorized by whether they respond to a particular therapy or not. Heart attacks were divided into Q-wave and non Q-wave MIs when tPA turned out to work for one but not the other. Then NQWMIs were combined with unstable angina into acute coronary syndrome when they were found to respond to similar therapies.

Doctors are pragmatic people. If subtle dissection of disease categories won't change the treatment modality, we don't have time to sit there and use up mental cycles to do that. (Except neurologists, they love doing that, perhaps because for the longest time they didn't have any therapies that worked).

But the core of your question is valid. Whether something is viewed as a disease or not and what kinds of disease it's considered to be does depend partially on its frequency.

For example, phenylketonuria (PKU is a disease where some people who lack a particular enzyme to break down phenylalanine) would not be considered to be a disease if everyone lacked that enzyme. If someone died from eating phenylalanine, it would be seen as a poisoning.

As another example, if almost everyone had CCR5 mutations, then people who didn't have the protective mutations and contracted AIDS would not be considered to have an infectious disease but rather a genetic disease.

20,StoicOptom,"&gt; However, the main issue I encounter when talking to clinicians is that such a preventative approach (i.e. medicalising the general public with senolytics, or what have you) is extremely unappealing.

&gt; A major argument they rely upon is that investing into this preventative approach means taking money away from cancer/heart disease research etc. and therefore harming patients who are sick *today*.

Again, this is a false dichotomy that is incredibly revealing of the sheer ignorance of the physicians you talk to. This is the main problem with the entire apparent/alleged philosophical argument. 

Remember that clinicians very rarely have a strong grasp of basic science, especially when it pertains to aging. Medicine literally has a specialty called geriatrics, where they essentially treat symptoms, remove medications to reduce polypharmacy (another symptom of the failed single-disease approach to medicine) and are nearly completely ignorant of aging biology despite literally specialising in 'aging'. Most of them don't even *try* to understand aging as the root cause of disease and develop therapeutics to ameliorate the comorbidities of age - thankfully that is changing with the next generation of geriatricians - although very slowly.

Cue to anti-aging research, they're studying old cells and notice accumulation of damage. Did anyone investigate if the accumulation of damage is a symptom and not the cause of aging? What if the cell starts losing its function the older it gets and because of that, damage is starting to accumulate as a consequence? Removing that damage wont make the cell work better, the damage they observe is only a symptom in this case, and removing it wont solve anything.

My comments are as follows:

* NF-kB is primarily involved in upregulation of inflammation.  You seem to be advocating that the causes of ageing are essentially the result of increased chronic inflammation.  If that were the case, why don't people who have broken inflammatory systems stop aging?  Why don't anti-inflammatories like TNF-alpha antagonists or prednisone show a stronger propensity for extending life.

* I think evidence better suggests that chronic inflammation is a *symptom* of aging, not the cause of it.

* Regarding HERV-K, I view the activation of these endogenous retroviruses as an inevitable outcome of the loss of epigenetic inactivation and thus a symptom of the real cause of aging.  Additionally, they may be contributing to the aging itself when they become highly active and induce DNA instability.  Their interaction with NF-kB is likely an evolutionary adaptation to help promote their own replication.

* If ERV's are the cause of aging, do you postulate that using some technology similar to CRISPR to destroy the replication abilities of the ERV's would result in a mouse that did not age?  Could a mouse egg be produced that did this...resulting in an immortal mouse?  I am skeptical, but I think such an experiment might show interesting results.",1,1574452649,longevity

&gt; DW: Your company, neotiv, has developed an app to research neurodegenerative diseases in their early stages. You're also involved with the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). What's the aim of your app, and how does it work?

&gt; Professor Emrah Düzel: The aim is to improve the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the future — that's our global aim. And one of the major hurdles there is that it's very difficult to diagnose, track, and monitor the disease. That makes it very difficult to recognize the early stages of the disease and start prevention in time.

&gt; The app is designed to track the cognitive performance of the participants — Alzheimer's patients and a control group — over a long period of time. Participants also have to answer questionnaires. And you're looking specifically at getting people, ""citizen scientists"" if you like, to track their cognitive performance, even when they've had a bad night's sleep, or they've got the flu. Why?

&gt; Well, first, we want [the app] to become a medical device at some point, one that has a strong basis in science, so that's why we have these ties to the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Then we also want to reach out to the public to inform and empower citizens, so that they know about the early aspects of Alzheimer's. And we want to empower science. One of the hardest aspects of Alzheimer's research is understanding the impact of intermittent health conditions on the main symptom of the disease, which is memory impairment.

&gt; There are so many intermittent and unpredictable health events that it's hard for science to know their effect. But you can't just have people come into a clinic when they've got flu.

&gt; How does your app compare to traditional cognitive performance tests, pen-and-paper tests, which, we've learnt, have issues, such as cultural biases or so-called learning effects, where if you know the test, you'll know how to answer, and that can skew the results?

&gt; Those existing tests were designed 30 or 40 years ago at a time when we didn't really know how the brain works. But now we have a very clear idea of where the disease starts in the brain and how it progresses. So we can design tests in such a way that they first address the brain areas that are affected initially, and then consider how the disease might progress. And that's what we've done. 

&gt; We've also designed the tests so that they can be used in many different countries, so that they don't depend on a [person's language skills]. 

&gt; The idea is that our app will give general practitioners (GPs) and other health professionals, and scientists, a probability as to whether a person has a form of Alzheimer's in their brain.

Abstract:

&gt;Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising fluid biomarker of disease progression for various cerebral proteopathies. Here we leverage the unique characteristics of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and ultrasensitive immunoassay technology to demonstrate that NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (n = 187) and serum (n = 405) are correlated with one another and are elevated at the presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer’s disease. Longitudinal, within-person analysis of serum NfL dynamics (n = 196) confirmed this elevation and further revealed that the rate of change of serum NfL could discriminate mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers almost a decade earlier than cross-sectional absolute NfL levels (that is, 16.2 versus 6.8 years before the estimated symptom onset). Serum NfL rate of change peaked in participants converting from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and was associated with cortical thinning assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, but less so with amyloid-β deposition or glucose metabolism (assessed by positron emission tomography). Serum NfL was predictive for both the rate of cortical thinning and cognitive changes assessed by the Mini–Mental State Examination and Logical Memory test. Thus, NfL dynamics in serum predict disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the early presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer’s disease, which supports its potential utility as a clinically useful biomarker.

I did touch on that when I said it was multifactorial.  

&gt; Multifactorial: involving or dependent on a number of factors, especially genetic or environmental factors.

People have different genetic risk and environmental factors.    So that's why people age without developing AD. 

Age is the greatest risk factor.  Things that go wrong in aging are hallmarks of AD (see citations).   Targeting the things that go wrong in aging for AD, may end up being beneficial to everyone if the damage is general enough.

I think the science is slowly forming a consensus about the root cause of aging, and as far as I know now one is yet working on therapies for that.

In the meantime, there are 2 or 3 strong therapies being worked on for first order effects.  (nmn or nr, metformin, senescent cells, reprogrammed stem cells to clear proteins... etc)  But lets be clear the SENS stuff is definitely a therapy aimed at a first order symptom, not a cure for aging. (and let me be even more clear, I expect it to be VERY successful, I just want to make sure that everyone knows it's not the final end game.

Here is a link to that previous post of mine:  https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/9hjevj/the_4_epochs_of_longevity/

70,John_Schlick,"On 1: I left it out because have not heard of the Unity trial (I read as much as I can, and I freely admit there are only so many hours in a day, and I'm not perfect).  Do you have a link to it?  I would love to read it.

2: Double stranded breaks.  What I know is that the proteins (coded for in genes) that are involved in double stranded breaks seem to screw up the epigenome all over the place as part of doing there job.  but only a little bit at a time (as in only a little every time we get a double stranded break, and compounded by when that happens in a stem cell).  Also, there are (this is a number in my head not a well researched number by me) about 200 genes that make proteins that all have a piece of that job.  It's a very complex system.

You may be correct, we may be able to use a gene therapy to edit our dna to perfect those proteins that misbehave.  I would never disount that as an option.  But I personally feel like resetting the epigeniome has tools to do it today, and so it appears to me to be the path of least resistance. and it appears to have a HUGE upside.

3: I do indeed mean ""know something"" not ""know the only thing"".  With every biologic system that I have read papers for, it's a question of assigning percentages of causation.  it's very clear to me that the epigenome gets screwed up and causes cellular disregulation.   but is that the only thing that causes symptoms of aging?   One of the things the SENS people are working on is the removal of extra cellular proteins that build up in the body.    Now, do they build up because we have no genes to get rid of them, or is it because the cells that are supposed to clear them out are not working properly due to being mis-regulated.   I've seen one presentation (and haven't read a peer reviewed paper on it) that macular degeneration (a symptom of aging) is caused due to a build of a specific protein in the eye and there a gene that needs a one base pair change to clear THAT protein.  So, it strikes me that perfectly regulating a gene that can't do the job? Won't solve the problem.

The thing about biological systems is that it's like you as a computer scientist peering into an ai system with 200 variables and none of them are labeled to tell you what they do, and trying to figure out if you can tune the system better than your training data.  They are messy and complicated and have lots nad nlots and lots of unlabeled inputs.

I feel like we are on the cusp of getting to a large number of ways to mitigate aging, but once we do that...  and we wait say another 50 years... what will be the first part of a body to break down after those first treatments - whats the thing that got missed?   When was release 1.0 (or even 4.0) ever perfect?   The answer of course is that it's not.

72,arcturnus,"&gt;I have a follow up question on funding. How dire do you think the funding situation is for aging research? Put another way, is the field currently more starved for talent and interest, or for funding?

That's a really good question, and one where I'm not in a position to best answer, but I'll share my thoughts. If we ignore the private sector for a moment and just focus on basic research in academia, then despite wanting us to spend far more money on research than we do, I'd say we are more in need of passionate researchers than funds, simply because if you were to pursue a degree in aging biology you would have no problem getting into a lab. There aren't many biologists sitting on the sidelines waiting for funding. (That being said, there is a difference between working in an academic lab while you are doing grad work and getting a degree to go work in a lab. If you look at the openings at Calico for example, they aren't looking for people who just graduated with a B.S. in biology. Some of their openings say BS/MS or PhD, but you don't hire someone with just a BS for a Senior Research position unless they are an anomaly, and most require a PhD plus experience. To get one of these jobs you could expect to have a PhD and have already done some postdoc work, so you're looking at 8 - 12 years of your life just to qualify for a position. Since you are already working as a data scientist you might actually qualify for one of the data positions now, so keep that in mind when figuring out where to best have an impact)

Two more caveats to my funding claim - first is my example. My goal was to get a PhD and do aging research, but that didn't happen. I had to stop after a BS due to my financial situation. Networks and programming were more of a hobby to me, but I had to pay the bills so things switched. If I had had the ability to continue pursuing biology I would have, so in my case financial incentives mattered a lot. I have also met a handful of other people in my career who went from biology to computer science for similar reasons. So while I am only a sample size of one, and my experiences are very anecdotal evidence, it does seem to me that if there was more money there might be more biologists.

The second caveat is that if a rich country like the US really wanted to do something, it could fund it massively. The fact that the private sector has had to take the reigns on aging research is a symptom of ""average"" citizens not caring about curing aging. We spend a good amount of our tax dollars on cancer and HIV research (to name a few), and a ton of tax dollars on things like the military, but extremely little on aging. If we as a society decided we wanted to cure aging, a government could fund that pursuit in a way that makes the private funding of Calico, Human Longevity, SENS, etc... seem pitiful.

An example of the power of society backing research in biology on a massive scale is embryonic stem cells (ES). When human ES were isolated in 1998, we couldn't deny the huge potential of ES but there were ethical and practical issues to having the source only be from an embryo. The ethical concerns of society pushed governments into funding a solution. Cell differentiation is incredibly complicated, perhaps even more complicated than aging itself, but in less than a decade a team from Japan had found a way to turn human skin cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), effectively ES without needing the embryo. That is what we need for aging research, a societal push so massive that governments fund aging research at the same level as they did stem cell research. If anything would have an impact on aging research, it would be finding a way to evangelize at this level.

I am actually in a similar situation as you find yourself, albeit I am a bit older, which is one reason I bothered to reply. While my career has been great, I am looking to get back into biology in some way in the next few years. I have spent the last couple years trying to answer the questions you are asking, ""where can I have the biggest impact?"" I believe small amounts of funding increases won't do much, but if a society would choose to make aging research a priority that would change everything. However evangelism of that level is daunting and could be fruitless and I haven't found a compelling path forward (how do you even begin to get a society to care about something like this? how long will it take to do so? a generation or more? etc...). So I still haven't figured out exactly how I'll get back into biology and help with aging research, but hopefully some of my ramblings will help you on your path.

&gt;Basically the biggest question on my mind is if I should dedicate to high level attempts to improve the funding in aging research, or become an individual contributor and add myself to the talent pool. It is difficult for me to pinpoint my existing knowledge which area is in most dire need.

So the TL;DR of my thoughts above would be that unless you feel you can influence the government of an advanced nation into funding a substantial aging program, I don't think high level attempts to improve funding will have the impact you are looking for (despite the need for funding). As an individual contributor it is hard to tell. You are going about researching things the right way, trying to see what is being done and what might be the most promising avenue, but science is very much full of serendipity rather than a clear path to discovery (one reason it doesn't lend itself to a VC model of funding). You could end up playing a minor role, or you could stumble upon a discovery that changes the game, having a gigantic impact. Going into direct research might take you a decade of your life to get there, but doing something in computational biology or data science might be a direct jump for you. In that case, you might also be able to keep your salary (although I can't speak for stock options, quarterly and yearly bonuses, guaranteed annual raises, and all the other perks of working for a SV tech company).

&gt;There’s also people constantly discussing entrepreneurship, and hence there’s the low probability route of going for a standard tech startup route with a few peers, succeeding, then using the payoff to donate to research, fund awareness, etc. Essentially try to become a significantly less stingy Peter Thiel, as you brought up.

I'll end by saying this could be a good path. You are only 23, you have some time. My advice (having gone through a few failed startups myself) is to have a clear plan regarding how much you plan on making to donate, how many years max you are okay with spending to get there, what to do if the startup fails before that, and what to do after you succeed. You can also spend the time building your company doing more research in aging and biology and keeping tabs on the field, further refining what you will do once you have the cash to fund something (you'll only have so much time, a startup generally consumes your life). This is, more or less, the path I kinda tried to take. It didn't work out for me, but it may work for you.",1,1518809417,longevity

The long-term adverse effects of chronic pharmaceutical interventions for chronic diseases aren't seen in clinical trials, and pile up as additional drugs are prescribed to relieve the side effects of others.

* there is also some debate as to whether aging has a root cause (like a master regulator set of genes) or if it is many different processes that happen somewhat independently, this is important to know if we want to modify the process with a therapeutic. 

* there will be small molecule (drug) and genetic (gene therapy) strategies to reverse or delay symptoms of aging. These have different considerations in terms of one-time treatment vs. Continuous treatment, who can benefit from it, etc. 

* it is technically possible to engineer the engineer the human germ line (modified humans will reproduce, pass on modified genes), this raises ethical, legal, social questions that are by no means settled yet.

* One degree safer (more likely to be approved) would be modifying genes of adults but not their germ cells (modified genes aren't passed on). This would be a gene therapy, not many are approved today, but thousands are in clinical trials. 

* On the other hand, once a small molecule aging drug gets approval, that is a more simple process 

* if a master regulator is responsible for the decline in many areas of health associated with aging, then maybe there will be a holy grail drug that reverses the whole process. More likely, in my opinion, is that we will solve each symptom or set of symptoms (muscle mass, wrinkles, bone strength, many more...) separately ",5,1466936657,longevity
86,Yosarian2,"Ah, I see what you mean.

Still, if the symptom of a disease is what's going to kill you, then it's totally reasonable to treat that symptom directly.   And in this case, it seems like the high blood pressure itself is what's going to directly kill you, even though that's likely being caused by plaques on your arteries or whatever.

87,MaunaLoona,"Thanks for the summary even though I read the article, but that didn't answer my question.

For example, the body raises its temperature when invaded by a foreign agent such as a virus. This helps it fight the disease. The fever is a symptom and is intentional. There are drugs to reduce fever, but they might be diminish  the body's ability to fight the disease.

Likewise, I suspect people have high blood pressure for a reason -- it could be the body's response to conditions such as partially blocked arteries or not enough blood is getting to the brain. Reducing blood pressure without treating the underlying disease might be deleterious.",1,1442099271,longevity

89,ahfoo,"Lot's of correlations but not too many clear causes being teased out here. The studies that show correlations between ""excessive"" sleep and morbidity have a huge barrier to overcome in showing that it is the sleep causing the morbidity and not that it is a symptom of some other underlying issue.

90,dz93,Poverty is the most deadly disease in existence. Not only does it cause you to not foresee future events based on current actions but it also causes you to recklessly consume every resource in your sight without a single thought about it. The disease has also been shown to cause parents to stop caring for their children. They typically develop the idea that higher education is bad. As a final symptom of the disease it also creates a huge urge to find and use the hardest drugs they can causing them to sell and steal anything in sight to get money for the drugs. Poverty is a horrible disease. Worse than dementia or anything else. ,1,1434543664,longevity
